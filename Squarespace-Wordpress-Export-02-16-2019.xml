      <title>Why Men and Women are Perfect for Each Other</title>
      <link>/blog/why-men-and-women-are-perfect-for-each-other</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It's been a matter of intense debate and discussion, this battle between the sexes. For centuries, men and women of all ages have been trying to prove that their sex, referring to gender, is superior to the other. My point here is to show how no matter how you construe it, neither of the sexes is any better than the other, and how amazingly well men and women complement each other, and in so doing, answer the posed question, why are men and women perfect for each other.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To begin, there are some obvious distributions of natural ability, found in one of the sexes far more often than in the other. No one would debate, for example, the capability of a woman to be more tender, warm, and loving than a man, and no one in their right mind would debate the man's natural sense of physical strength, and emotional control. (Remember, I am not speaking about each person as an individual, but more about general natures.) Women are more tender, warm, willing to genuinely compliment. Women have a tendency to be much more organized, and seem to have a knack for financial frugality and fidelity, at least in their more mature years. Women are far more attractive than men, and are much more attentive to matters of hygiene and appearance. Meticulous is a word that much more often describes a woman than a man. And, of course, there is a thing called motherhood that men just can't pull off. Women not only were built for it physically, but they have the psychological know-how that men just can't duplicate. There is nothing like a mother's influence in the early years of a child's life. The list, of course, could continue for a long time, and had I time, I would continue. in order, however, to make the point, we must turn our attention to the male half of the human race.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Men have strengths in different places than women do. Men are more naturally strong in a physical sense, never afraid to just go do it. Men have that numb-skulled go get 'er-ness that is great for getting things done. Men are all about talk less and do more. Men are far more reserved emotionally than women, and that reservedness tends to spill over into social life, as well. Women tend to talk, while men sort of stand there. Men, as a whole, thanks to that emotional reservedness, are more suited for the work force, where it doesn’t really matter how you feel, as much as "go do it." A man is more suited to be the breadwinner for a family for the same reasons. Day in, day out, go do it. Men are great for shoulders to cry on, arms to cry in, and a sense of protection from the storms of life. I think that’s all the good things that I can say about men, so I'll continue on to my next point.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Where there are pluses, there must be minuses, and both sexes, in turn, have areas that are lacking, at least in the view of the other sex. I attribute this misunderstanding between men and women to one simple fact: Women think too much, and men don't think at all. If I had more time, I would prove that statement with examples, but for now it will suffice to say that most of the frustration and confusion between the two is that women thing so much about everything, and want men to do so as well, while on the other hand, men don’t take things for much more than face value, and wish that women would just mean what they say, and say what they mean. And we see why men will never understand women, and why women will always be frustrated with men. I am not trying to say that one is better, and the other should change, it’s good for both sexes, because as they learn to live with each other, the man begins to read the little signals that his wife is constantly sending, and begins to pay more attention to those, than to what she is actually saying. He never really fully grasps it, because he will always make mistakes, but whatever. And on the other hand, the wife learns to dumb down her speech a little bit for her husband's benefit. One could, from a neuter standpoint, neither defending or offending men or women, deduce that there are in fact no inherently bad qualities, or defects in either sex, just different ones that complement each other.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So we see that men and women complement each other. Why are women so beautiful and men so ugly, well, someone needs to be good looking, and someone needs to have looks that can get thrown into the dirt a little? Why are women more organized? Because men aren't. Why are women more emotional than men? Because men are their foundation. Why are men more reserved about emotion? Because they are the foundation of the women. They are the shoulder to cry on. Why are women so concerned about their appearance? Because if they weren't we'd all look like slobs. Why do men go to the office all day, and take the kids to dinner when mom isn't around? Because not only are women better cooks, men can't cook.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The point of this whole thing is to point out that really, women and men are equal, and neither is better or worse. Of course, most women do a better job at what they do than men, but thats not what we're talking about......</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>PDA….is ok!</title>
      <link>/blog/pda-is-ok</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I want to preface this by saying that I did not write this with any particular person in mind. Some of you may think that I wrote this directly to you, and that’s not really the case. There have been so many instances in my life that have led up to me writing this, so to pin it on one person or instance would be both unfair and illogical. This is merely a statement of opinion, my opinion, and all comments and rebuttals and support is welcome. Know, however, that I am perfectly willing to defend this entire piece, so if you want to fight about it, bring it on :) (and I mean that in the nicest way)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So there are about a million articles and posts and junk everywhere from what I like to call anti-PDA fanatics, saying how gross PDA is, and fake barfing when people say lovey things about their significant other. I personally disagree with that on a very passionate level, and so I'm going to express the feelings of that very not dead portion of society known as "hopeless romantics".</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Its funny to me how most of the argument of people who say PDA is gross and that they don't want to see it or hear it always use the fact that the couple is not respecting the rights of the observer, and this line is always used, "I don't want to see that!" The thing I find funny is that those people assume that the couple is kissing or being affectionate in public to aggravate them, and not to enjoy a romantic moment with each other. They try to defend their "right" to not have to look at that. Well I've got news for that argument....look somewhere else :)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The next group of anti-PDA people that I want to address are those inside a relationship that will not allow public affection in the relationship. I simply don't get it. Are they scared of the other anti-PDA-ers? Public opinion? I don't really understand what could hold any person in a relationship that truly likes their partner back from showing them how they really feel. If you do like someone, and you do want to kiss them, why not just kiss them? Why the games? Its counterproductive, if you ask me. If you really do consider yourself the luckiest person in the world to be with them, why not say it? Don't you want them to know how you feel?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, on the flipside, there is a point where it gets to be too much. You can't make all of your conversation be totally lovey dovey, and you can't be making out all the time in public, and definitely not too heavily. Moderation in all things, I say, but an occasional kiss or kind word is NOT bad. It's good. Even a passionate kiss at the appropriate moment in public is just fine, and is nothing to jeer at or be upset about. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What happened to love being something that made people all warm and fuzzy? I know when I see a couple kissing in public, it honestly makes me all warm and fuzzy inside, and I think of the one that I love, and wish I could be with her right then. Love, and its expression, makes me happy. And isn't that what life is all about anyway? To learn to love, and then love? </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>If you think I’m sexist…..</title>
      <link>/blog/if-you-think-im-sexist</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So I was in my writing class today (it's actually a philosophy class but that has nothing to do with anything) and my professor pointed something out that I simply will not accept. There's nothing wrong with my professor; he's a great man. He just happens to be the guy who has to say these ridiculous things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So we are talking about grammar and spelling and things and we were each given a paper with statements that supposedly had grammatical errors that we were to correct. One of these statements went something like this:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although the candidate is new to politics she has a good chance at winning.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It turns out that there isn't anything grammatically wrong with that sentence, but my professor used this sentence to bring up the issue of sexism in writing. According to the Modern Language Association (MLA), "Grammar checkers are good at flagging obviously sexist terms, such as mankind and fireman, but they do not flag language that might be demeaning to women (woman doctor) or stereotypical (referring to assistants as women and lawyers as men, for instance). They also have no way of identifying the generic use of he or his (An obstetrician needs to be available to his patients anytime, day or night). You must use your common sense to tell when a word or a construction is offensive."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even more disturbing that than is a list of words that I can no longer use apparently because they are sexist. Here are some examples:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Anchorman</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chairman</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Clergyman</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Congressman</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fireman</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Foreman</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mailman</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To man (verb)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mankind</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Manpower</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Policeman</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Salesman</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Weatherman</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Workman</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Now I have to genericize those words so as to not offend women. The most outrageous part of the whole thing is the fact that while using the word "he" to signify a generic gender is sexist, the word "she" in the same context used for the same purpose is not sexist, but is considered perfectly acceptable. It's affirmative action all over again. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To save this from becoming a novel, which it very easily could, I will just say my two cents and you'll get my drift.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you think I'm sexist,you are sexist. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>White Men: A Social Commentary</title>
      <link>/blog/white-men-a-social-commentary</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An episode of 30 Rock (amazingly hilarious show) brought up a very interesting point. Two characters, one a black man (Tracy Jordan played by Tracy Morgan), and one a white woman (Jenna Maroney played by Jane Krakowski), argue over who has it "harder" in life because of social oppression, black people or women. The reach a point where to prove their respective points, they "switch places". Tracy Jordan dons makeup and a blond wig to become a white woman, while Jenna dresses up like a black man. I would like to point out that Jenna's get-up is far more convincing than Tracy's, but that has nothing to do with anything.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At this point, Jack Donaghy (Played by Alec Baldwin) appears on the chaotic scene and they both present him with their arguments as to why their particular situation is the more oppressed. His response:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"I'll tell you has it the hardest: White Men. We make the unpopular, difficult decisions, the tough choices. We land on the moon and Normandy beach and yet they resent us..."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I realize that this is a comical approach to the political issue, but I honestly agree with that. White men are blamed for all of the world’s problems, and are the first to be accused of racism and sexism. Never do you hear of a black or Hispanic accused of being racist. I have never heard of a woman being accused of being sexist. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What I don't understand, and therefore absolutely reject, is the notion that there are certain phrases that automatically make a white man racist, but those same exact phrases used in the exact same context to convey the exact same message, if used by any other ethnicity, are totally and completely acceptable. We white men simply allow them to take advantage of us because evil and mistaken men who happened to share our skin color within the past few centuries mistreated good, upstanding men and women who share their skin color. I do not mean to demean or belittle the atrocities that have been committed against minorities, for I personally abhor the thought of racism. My issue is that I did not and have not committed a racist act in my entire life, and yet I constantly am having to change the way I speak in order to not become racist because of a single off-hand remark. Why should I be punished for the actions of men in another time, and another place? I firmly assert that I would have been opposed to racial prejudices and slavery had I lived in those times, just as I do now. Nothing of my upbringing or standing would have ever hinted at that being acceptable or right. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In conclusion, and again to avoid what could easily become a novel, I will summarize my point in one statement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you think I'm racist, you are racist. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Clean the corners, and the middle will take care of itself</title>
      <link>/blog/clean-the-corners-and-the-middle-will-take-care-of-itself</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One Saturday I was in the middle of my weekly "responsibilities" at home and, as usual, I was dragging my feet to do a complete job. I had a particular problem doing chores all the way, and I think it annoyed mom quite a bit. I would never quite do the job completely. I would always clean up the big obvious parts of the room that I was supposed to clean, but often the little details would be completely forgotten. In fact, often it was simply that I would vacuum around the couches and things that were against the walls, and mom always wanted me to move everything and vacuum the whole floor. Anyway, on this particular Saturday, I think I was in charge of the family room, which involved lots of moving furniture to really clean. I don't know where mom got this quote, but she came in and told me, "Clean the corners, and let the middle take care of itself."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a second there, that made no sense to me. Was I supposed to just clean the corners and the rest would magically be cleaned? I had no idea what she meant, but for once in my young years I actually listened to mom and tried it. You know, interestingly enough, it worked like a charm. Instead of just vacuuming the middle of the room and then trying to avoid cleaning the rest, I just started with the corners and edges of the room and went from there. I was surprised at how much easier it was to work that way. Cleaning was never the same for me after that. I always started with the corners and worked my way inward, and it was always easier and quicker. Then after a while, mom started applying that quote to more than just cleaning.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I found it interesting when mom talked about cleaning the corners in a lesson about repentance and change. She didn't really go into much detail or explain very much, but I've thought about that a lot over the years. In general, I've noticed that if I just deal with the main problem in a situation, and leave the outer problems to themselves, the problem actually get's worse. It's kinda like if just cut a weed off at the ground instead of pulling out the roots, it just grows back bigger. If I take care of all of the little issues first before tackling the big problem, however, the whole thing gets resolved. If you just try to take out the head boss of a criminal organization, you still have a bunch of angry criminals running around causing trouble. If you take out the little guys, however, the boss can't really do much and he's an easy target, and will probably just give up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The biggest reason for this, I found out later, is that 9 times out of ten, having to do a lot of cleanup work after solving a problem can just create more problems, and even re-create the original problem. If you spend too much time having to think about a problem after the problem is resolved, you never let it go, and your mind creates the problem all over again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The point is sometimes it's better to work your way to a big problem by solving the smaller related problems first. Busting in like John Wayne (Garth Brooks reference) just makes a mess that you have to clean up later.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>There are 2 kinds of pain: the Pain of Discipline and the Pain of Regret</title>
      <link>/blog/there-are-2-kinds-of-pain-the-pain-of-discipline-and-the-pain-of-regret</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think this was mom's favorite quote, and she adopted it sometime during my sophomore or junior year of high school. This one has had more application in my life than any other phrase or idea I think. In fact, I have spread this around, and now it's pretty well known in some areas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It basically explains itself, but I'll try to do it justice:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For every situation, there are usually a few different options as far as what you can do in that situation. We are choosing to do things every day, and everything we do stems from one or more of those decisions. We cannot, however, choose the consequences of our actions, meaning we can't choose to get a raise if we choose to slack off at work. We can, however, make decisions based on the consequences, and also based on what I like to call pre-emotion and post-emotion.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pre-emotion is not a difficult concept, it's simply the emotion that we feel at the beginning or before we make a decision. This includes all of our thought processes, ideas, opinions and has a lot to do with our current life status and the way we were raised. Post-emotion is the feeling we get at the end or after we've made our choice and felt the consequences. It's important to understand that post-emotion is not the immediate result of the choice, but the feeling after the decision has fully been made and all consequences of that choice have been enjoyed or suffered. This is where discipline and regret come in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When analyzing a situation or decision, it is important to take into consideration both your pre-emotion and your post-emotion. Your pre-emotion can very drastically affect your choice, because people base most of their choices on what they have previously experienced, which is usually good. For example, a person who was given an extreme amount of sympathy as a child would lean toward giving sympathy to a friend, whereas someone who was given little sympathy in childhood would most likely look for other ways to help a friend, such as leaving them alone, trying to get them away from the bad situation, or simply giving them 'tough love'. Another example is a person who has never really learned or experienced the consequences of procrastination. If presented with a situation where there is a choice between procrastinating and not procrastinating, that person will feel no urge to be proactive, and therefore will most likely put off the duty until the very last minute. Then once you have a good understanding of your pre-emotion, you need to consider the post-emotion.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our pre-emotion is simply what we are inclined to do based on our past. When considering post-emotion is when the consideration of the 2 Pains comes in. On the one hand, we have the choice to satisfy our immediate needs or desires, succumbing to the desire for immediate gratification. This choice almost invariably leads to the eventual Pain of Regret. Very seldom is a choice that results in immediate pleasure not followed by a situation that would present even more satisfaction and pleasure, but because of that initial choice, you are disqualified from even taking part in the second situation. This is when the Pain of Regret stings with all its fury. "Oh if only I had not been so selfish in the beginning, I could experience this greater joy now," is the lament of those inflicted with this Pain. Those who chose immediate discipline, however, sing an altogether different song.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If in the consideration of post-emotion we consider that denying ourselves of a certain pleasure now will result in greater satisfaction later, we are choosing the Pain of Discipline. This Pain can be sharp and in some instances almost unbearable, but without exception the result is long-lasting satisfaction that is far superior to the immediate pleasure experienced by those who chose the Pain of Regret. Take for example the person who trains for years for a marathon race, building up endurance and discipline. When they run the race, while it is painful in its own right, they can not only actually finish the race, but do well, and the satisfaction of the win far outweighs the pain of the race. A person who has not trained for a marathon may in fact by some stroke of luck or superhuman strength do well in the race, but the pain he/she will feel as a result of running a marathon without putting in the necessary preparation will far outweigh any pleasure they receive from placing well in the race.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take whatever personal application you will from this; the principle applies almost universally. You will have to experience one of these 2 Pains as a result of every choice you make. The difference is that following the Pain of Discipline there is always great satisfaction, whereas following the Pain of Regret there is nothing but a continuation of that Pain. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Choose wisely. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Treat people like they already are what you want them to become</title>
      <link>/blog/treat-people-like-they-already-are-what-you-want-them-to-become</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dad is my hero for so many reasons, but I think the biggest reason is because in so many ways I want to be able to be half the father he was to me to my children. He always has had such a way with people, and not only have I never heard anyone say a single bad thing about him, I have never once heard him say anything negative about anyone. No exceptions. I'll talk more about being positive later, but I just wanted to preface these next two lessons with that fact.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dad taught me this lesson partially just by example and in a small way it was a lesson that he sat me down to teach. He taught me better than anyone else to give people the benefit of the doubt, and seeing how much people love him has made me really latch on to this. I think he applied this principle to his relationship with me more than I saw it anywhere else. When I was young, dad must have noticed how I loved to sit and listen when he and my older brothers and brothers-in-law would talk about grown up stuff, because by the time I made it to high school, dad was including me in these conversations, and he even had many such conversations with me one on one. Dad made me feel so important and smart, and really let me contribute to the conversations. And yet, I always came away having learned so much. This developed into a very deep relationship between dad and me, and some of my best memories of me and dad together are our deep conversations after church on Sundays.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I've come to realize over time that when I treat people like they are already doing what I want them to or what they need to, without exception they always rise to the occasion. Training mission companions was a perfect example of this. If I treated a companion like they were so green that they couldn't do anything, I would find myself doing all the talking, teaching, planning, studying, and deciding, and I actually stunted the learning of my companions. But when I finally got a brand new missionary, I treated him like a regular junior companion that had been in the country almost as long as I had. He learned so much faster when I treated him like an equally capable missionary to myself. Since then, I have noticed this same principle in so many different places.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The principle behind this lesson is that people deserve to feel good about themselves, and sometimes the only thing that keeps a person from really pushing for their potential is a person who gives them the idea that they aren't capable. A child who is treated like a child will remain a child. An adult who is treated like a child will act like a child. A dancer who is treated like a failure will almost without exception fail. Any person who is treated like they are worthless will eventually believe it. If you want a child to act more like an adult, treat them like an adult! You can't expect a child to learn responsibility if you are always telling them what to do and how to do it. That, however, doesn't mean give them total free reign to do whatever they want and walk all over you. The world will not let them walk all over anyone that they want, so don't you let them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By the same token, if you have an employee that you want to up their work standard so you can advance them, treat them like they deserve to be advanced. Not only will your workers respect you more, they will actually live up to the compliments that you give them. Allowing those that are under you to rise to greater responsibility is the best and only way to have a functioning and thriving work environment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Workers, like children and people in general, are either improving or digressing at any given point, and a sure fire way to ensure improvement is to encourage and reward it. If you have an employee who is slacking in his job, chances are he isn't just doing it to spite you. He may have some personal issue that is hidden from you that is distracting him from his tasks. He may be dissatisfied with his job, and therefore has no motivation to do well. Usually workers digress in performance because they don't want to be there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The plain fact is people love to be praised, and praise is something that people will work for. The paradox of praise, however, is that workers need praise to do well, and employers need results to give praise. So many people will argue either way about which side should start the process, but I believe whole-heartedly that it is the responsibility of the employer to provide a healthy work environment for his employees, meaning: Those in positions of leadership (parents, older siblings, employers, professors, religious leaders) are responsible to provide the motivation for those over whom they preside to do well. It is the leaders, not the followers, who have to lead, not just direct. If leaders will treat their employees like they are the best employees they have ever had, or if a parent will treat their children like they are the greatest children a parent could ask for, (and on into infinity with other examples) almost invariably those employees will actually be the best employees that the employer has ever had. Almost invariably, children who are told that they are the best children a parent could ask for will excel, because children who know they are noticed love to make their parents proud.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My conclusion to this is actually my thesis, and I would have made this statement at the beginning except I wanted to lay down some foundation before I said it. Taking into consideration what has been said about parents and children, and employers and employees, it's important to understand that we need to treat people like they are what we want them to be, or to put it better, we need to treat people as thought they are already what they want to be. Here is my conclusion; I hope you can get my point:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is the audience's responsibility to give the performers the applause necessary to perform well. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Learn to love silence</title>
      <link>/blog/learn-to-love-silence</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every once in a while, when you're driving late at night, turn off the music and just listen to the city. You'll be surprised at what happens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I actually did this one time. It's a fairly short story, but it illustrates the point I think.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One night I was driving home late and as usual, had my music on way loud and was just having a great time, and then I remembered what Dad always said about turning the music off, so at one intersection, I decided to try it. I turned off the music, and because my windows were down, immediately realized why Dad suggested that. The night has a music of its own, and everyone should have a chance to experience it. It works best when you are the only person on the road, but in general the idea is the same. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Try it. All growing up, and even today, I have loved listening to music, and I especially love listening to it loud. It would take too long to go into why that is, so let's just let that be that. When I started driving, it was like heaven because when I drive it's like free time to listen to music. Anyway, before my mission, I came home fairly late every night, and so often I would be driving down an empty road just blasting my music, having a great time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whenever Dad was driving with me, however, he made sure that the music was either really soft or off, and he would tell me how he would have his greatest inspiration while driving when there was nothing on. He had even made the change earlier from music to talk radio, and he gave up talk radio for silence. Dad always says that modern society is afraid of silence, and so we fill up as much of our time as possible with noise. He talks a lot about the different types of noise that we use to fill the space in our lives, and he always talks about how noise keeps us from receiving revelation from God. I'd like to shed a little bit of light on that idea.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I still like driving with the music loud, but I still turn it off every once in a while. During those times when the music is loud, I've noticed how often I miss phone calls because I can't hear my phone. In fact, it's not just when I'm driving. I like to play my guitar really loud, and I like to play alone to really loud songs, and I can almost never hear my phone ring. It has become a problem from time to time. This is an interesting example because it doesn't take too much of a stretch to give it very clear application. Noise in life crowds out the Spirit. Sometimes it's not even that what we are doing is bad, it's just so loud that we can't hear when the Spirit whispers. We should turn down the volume to the point that we can at least hear the cell phone. Interesting that we don't necessarily have to turn the music completely off to hear that phone go off.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In life we have so much to worry about that many times we find ourselves so swamped with good (and bad) noise that we sometimes miss our "phone calls". (this paragraph is meant to be very ambiguous) We miss out on more than we think when that happens. Those calls aren't always from the Spirit, many times they come from our families, our friends, our co-workers, and just people around us. The family on the side of the freeway with a flat tire, the homeless man whom we see every day, that friend who keeps calling because they really really need someone to just listen for a while - we either ignore the call or just send it to voicemail, because there is too much noise for us to see the importance of the call. We have a lunch meeting that we’re late for, or a date that we want to be early for, or we don't want to get our nice clothes dirty, or we don't want to waste the time by stopping, or we have so much homework to do, or we think that our needs are greater than their needs. I don't say any of this to judge anyone, and I really believe that all of those things are noble causes. Meetings are good things to be on time to, it's good to be a little early for a date, it's not wise to ruin all of your clothes, time is money, homework is very important, and sometimes we really do have greater needs than those around us. The point, I think, is that sometimes we have to forget ourselves and think of others first. The only way we can hear when others call, however, is if we turn down the noise enough to hear the phone ringing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(the ironic thing is that I would do well to apply this very lesson in my own life more) </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b29d50bc07b083624e43af9/1529468453315/pexels-photo-379636-e1498095608818.jpeg" alt=""/>
  

<p><span class="s1">When I rose up that fine spring day,</span><span class="s1">And gazed out at the dawn,
</span><span class="s1">The sun began, a single ray,
</span><span class="s1">Twas me it fell upon. </span>
<span class="s1">My servants came, began to say, </span>
<span class="s1">"The Hebrews, they all plea, </span>
<span class="s1">They want you to take this man </span>
<span class="s1">And nail him to a tree." </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">They told me all about him, </span>
<span class="s1">This man from Nazareth. </span>
<span class="s1">"He healed their sick, he gave them life </span>
<span class="s1">And now they want his death. </span>
<span class="s1">He has no fault, no single stain; </span>
<span class="s1">The law should set him free. </span>
<span class="s1">But now I fear, the Jews won't rest </span>
<span class="s1">'Till you nail him to a tree." </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">And so it was, that fateful day, </span>
<span class="s1">I went into the throng </span>
<span class="s1">To meet the man they wanted dead, </span>
<span class="s1">Yet who had done no wrong. </span>
<span class="s1">The Hebrews all around me, </span>
<span class="s1">They want the killer free. </span>
<span class="s1">"Take this man instead," they said, </span>
<span class="s1">And nail Him to a tree. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The man they threw before me, </span>
<span class="s1">I noticed as I saw, </span>
<span class="s1">Did not respond to jeers and shouts; </span>
<span class="s1">His wrists were bound and raw. </span>
<span class="s1">I asked him then, what he had done, </span>
<span class="s1">And of his royalty. </span>
<span class="s1">Then when he spoke he pierced me; I </span>
<span class="s1">Can't nail Him to a tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">His face was calm, his eyes aglow, </span>
<span class="s1">He stood condemned to die. </span>
<span class="s1">"I was born to be a King," He said, </span>
<span class="s1">"My kingdom is on high." </span>
<span class="s1">"Art Thou a king?" I asked Him then, </span>
<span class="s1">Confused I did not see, </span>
<span class="s1">I sent him off to Herod, </span>
<span class="s1">His decision it would be. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">And when they brought him back to me, </span>
<span class="s1">'Twas in the selfsame day, </span>
<span class="s1">They told me what had happened, </span>
<span class="s1">And then what he did say. </span>
<span class="s1">When Herod asked, "Art thou the Christ?" </span>
<span class="s1">He responded royally. </span>
<span class="s1">The priests said, "He speaks blasphemies, </span>
<span class="s1">This man from Galilee." </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">So Herod sent him back to me, </span>
<span class="s1">Robed in royal blue. </span>
<span class="s1">My soul was racked, my mind was torn, </span>
<span class="s1">I knew not what to do. </span>
<span class="s1">This man, I knew, had done no wrong </span>
<span class="s1">Since he left Galilee. </span>
<span class="s1">What should I do, let him go? </span>
<span class="s1">Or nail him to a tree? </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The Jews, I knew, when tempers flared </span>
<span class="s1">Won't rest until appeased. </span>
<span class="s1">And in keeping down insurgence, </span>
<span class="s1">My lord would be quite pleased. </span>
<span class="s1">My instinct and my Roman youth </span>
<span class="s1">Seemed to be telling me, </span>
<span class="s1">"Give the Jews Barabbas </span>
<span class="s1">And nail him to a tree." </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">And so it was, that fateful day, </span>
<span class="s1">I went into the throng. </span>
<span class="s1">I gave them whom they wanted dead, </span>
<span class="s1">Yet who had done no wrong. </span>
<span class="s1">The Hebrews all around me </span>
<span class="s1">Still want the killer free. </span>
<span class="s1">I took this man, this Jesus, and </span>
<span class="s1">I nailed Him to a tree.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>You learn to do by doing; you learn to be by being</title>
      <link>/blog/you-learn-to-do-by-doing-you-learn-to-be-by-being</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brad took a much more direct approach in his teaching, and frankly I loved his teaching method. It reminded me of Brigham Young, and I think that I have followed a lot in his footsteps. He was all about no-nonsense, just get it done tactics, and there was usually less psychology and reasoning and more just doing, which we'll get to in the next lesson. Very often he would point out that the answers to most of life's questions are fairly widely known, but people don't recognize them because they are so common place. He really taught me how to be practical and take a direct approach to life. He didn't mess too much with philosophy or deep thought; he just went to it and acted, and his lessons were all about doing something and less about philosophizing or deep thinking. It wasn't that he never thought deeply about things, however. It was just more that all deep thoughts for him were and are directly connected to an actual action.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I find it very interesting that there is usually a distinct difference between people who have just left school and entered a certain field and those who have been in the field for a while. A perfect example of this is the army or a mission. Straight out of boot camp or the MTC, many "greenies" still have no idea what they are doing, even though those people just spent 3 months non-stop studying what they would be doing. Those missionaries and soldiers that have more experience, however, are much more capable and adept. This has nothing to do with natural ability or intelligence; it has everything to do with the distinct difference between a conceptual understanding of something and a practical understanding with an application. You can't learn the piano by studying the motions of the fingers and the sounds of the piano. The only way to learn the piano is to sit down and actually play. You can't learn to play baseball just from watching it on TV your whole life. You have to get a mitt and a ball and go play!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, by the same token, you can't expect to learn to play baseball without ever watching a game or asking someone how to play. You can't really learn to play the piano well if you've never heard anyone play or never studied the keys or sounds of the piano itself. This is just to point out that life is not all action and no study, because learning is the precursor to all action. The point is to not get caught up in reading about how to sing, just go sing!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This principle extends into when we are not just trying to be able to do something, but also when we are trying to become something or someone. Becoming is not a mental thing. Becoming someone or something is a physical thing. It's an action. Instead of trying to study up on how to be a salesperson, just go sell something. Instead of trying to read on how to be a good parent, just go be a good parent! Instead of spending countless hours contemplating the best way to be honest, just be honest!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The point, as I have applied it, is that there is a time and place and correct duration for thought and contemplation, and then there is a point where you just need to get up and act. In conclusion, look before you leap, but if you look for too long you'll probably fall in.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Never talk negatively about someone you don’t know</title>
      <link>/blog/never-talk-negatively-about-someone-you-dont-know</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why, stupid? You don't know them!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I've been on both ends of this one enough to know a few things about why you shouldn't do this. Negativity is never a really good thing, mostly because the whole idea behind negativity is the exact opposite of positive. While there are some who try to convince themselves and others that what is negative is actually good for them, the truth remains that negative always leaves you with less, while positive leaves you with more. It's like trying to add negative five to ten to get fifteen. It will never happen. You can write down fifteen as the answer, and even be convinced that it's the right answer, but when the grades come in, you will have gotten it wrong. And yet people still continue to choose the negative and love to find everyone else's faults.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first point I'd like to make is that any person who talks negatively about someone else without taking the time to actually get to know that person is an absolute idiot. That sounds kind of harsh, and may offend some, but welcome to reality people. The plain fact of the matter is that until you know a person, you have no idea why they do what they do. How often do we get upset with someone about something only to then find out the reason why they acted that way, leaving us feeling really stupid and sorry. For example, your co-worker is always a few minutes late for work and always seems to get away with it, and so you go to complain to your boss, and it's explained to you that this particular co-worker is taking care of her father who had a stroke, and who also happens to be the single mother of 3 little kids. She sacrifices precious time with her children in the mornings to make sure that her father is comfortable, and then has to hurry her children out the door for school before rushing to work. Not only does she have these issues, but, you find out, she is the highest performing worker in your department, but refuses to be recognized because she doesn't want the attention. How do you feel now? I'd feel pretty stupid. How can any person assume to know everything surrounding any other person's decisions? There's only one answer. They can't.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Think about how you would feel if you had to make a tough decision and you found out later that people were criticizing your decision behind your back. For example, let’s say you are that single mom with the father who had a stroke, and you decide that he needs to be put in a care home, because you need to spend more time with your kids, and you find out that a co-worker has been criticizing your decision, saying that you should just make more time for your kids, not dump your father off in some facility. How much would that hurt, especially when you've spent months agonizing over that decision? You knew you had to do it, and it was already hard for you to even make that decision, but then to find out that people were criticizing your decision without even knowing what was going on? I know I would want to sit them down and chew them out, but most of the time you don't want to have to explain yourself to everyone you meet, just so they won't hate you from the get-go.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The real point here is this: Don't talk negatively about people you don't know, because it just causes pain all around. Be positive, and for crying out loud, give people the benefit of the doubt!</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Be Yourself</title>
      <link>/blog/be-yourself</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There's only one of you. We already have one of everyone else, and that's enough.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So often these days people are so convinced that they aren't good enough. We're all set on "keeping up with the Jones's" and making sure that we are "in" on the latest fads. We have to make it seem like we "fit in" so we try to act like those around us. There's always one "leader" of every group, and in order to fit in with that group, we have to emulate the leader. I think it’s ridiculous myself. The only thing that is accomplished is you end up with a group of the same person. How is that even enjoyable?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another huge problem I see with this idea is all of the notions that are so widely accepted just because someone else said them. How often as children did the little boys have to say they didn't like boy bands because the other kids would make fun of them? Or how many teenagers have acted like they hated cats when they really didn't have anything against them. They act like they don't like a certain thing just to fit in with everyone. For me it was N'Sync, the Backstreet Boys and country music. I have never in my life actually disliked any of that music, even though now I don't usually voluntarily listen to any of it. I remember as a teenager going on about how terrible boy bands were and how annoying country music is. I'll be honest; I actually like both in certain situations. In fact I have almost every Backstreet Boys song completely memorized and I can sing along with most country songs, and have been able to since I was in Junior High. If I were to get in a group of friends, however, I felt compelled to deny even being able to stand any of that music, because "none of my friends did". Looking back, I suspect that none of them really had any serious problem with the music either, but they had to keep up the "social norms".</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nobody wants to be the one person in a group that disagrees. It seems like it would be too awkward to handle. I say that’s the best kind of awkward. If other people can't accept a different point of view, they're too closed minded to be worth hanging out with. There's no fun in a group that agrees on everything, because there's no discussion there. You never get to see any other point of view but your own, and who's to say that just because an opinion is yours, it’s the correct one. I mean, if Columbus just went along with everyone else he would have never left Europe, and who knows if we would have ever ended up over here? If the early colonists on the east coast had just went along with what all the soldiers were saying and doing and hadn't stood up for their own opinion, who knows whether our country would even exist as it does today? If you get into a group that talks about something and you don't agree, make yourself heard. You don't have to just go around looking for fights, but if you don't agree with someone, honestly talk it out with them. Be open, because maybe you aren't right, but don't be afraid to be yourself, even it will be a little awkward for a little bit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the flip side, there's no reason for you to go around blabbing your opinion and just trying to make yourself right. I think there is definitely a difference between standing up for yourself and your opinions and beliefs and being a loudmouth. The point of bringing up your point is to help people see another side of the argument, not to try to take on the entire group in a debate. So if you see that the group is making good points that refute your argument, there's no reason to jump in and blab your opinion, unless you have some good counter arguments. Anyway, I'm getting off track here, so I'll bring it back around.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea here is to figure out who you are and then be that person. If you like certain things, don’t pretend not to just to please a crowd, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself and your beliefs. There's only one person in the whole world who thinks exactly like you do and has what you have to offer, and that's you, so don't rob us all of that person just because "society" likes a different type right now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Just be you. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Get Over Yourself</title>
      <link>/blog/get-over-yourself</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*Everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time just like you do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every once in a while we meet someone who just thinks they are God's gift to mankind. Sometimes it's a co-worker who thinks they know everything there is to know about everything, or a fellow student who adores the sound of their own voice and thinks they have the answers to every question, or just a friend who is always looking down on you and making you feel 2 feet tall. Regardless of who it may be, it's fairly annoying and it has a tendency to alienate people. Here are my words on that subject, and they are directed very strongly to those kinds of people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">GET OVER YOURSELF!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, the point of this post isn't to chew anybody out, but rather to provide insights into some situations, so I'll leave the raving at that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A lot of the time we all end up in that position of arrogance when we know we're right and everyone else is wrong. I know I've been there plenty; in fact I spent most of high school there. I basically figured that I knew how everyone should live and refused any other opinion or idea because it wasn't my own. I can remember countless times attempting to lecture some of my best friends, thinking that I needed to "save" them from themselves or they would be lost. I refused to accept that they would be just fine (they all are, by the way, in fact most of them turned out to be better than I did). It turned out that I was the hardest on the people that meant the most to me, even to the point of seriously offending them. I remember there was one instance where I had been such a jerk to one of my best friends that she asked that I completely leave her alone for a while. Even after that I didn’t really learn my lesson. I still tried to hold everyone to my own very high standard, a standard that I found even myself struggling to uphold. It wasn't until I was on my mission and got word that my friend had been killed in a car accident did I really start to contemplate all the crappy things I had done to her and said to her, and how I won’t have a chance in this life to really apologize for any of that. I thought long and hard about how stubbornly proud I had been, and about how many people feelings I had bruised in my attempt to be right and respected. I want to say, to any of you out there who may have been mistreated by me and I haven't adequately apologized, I am so sorry. I am different now, and I can look back and see that I was not the easiest person to get along with back then. Anyway, this is not meant as an apology per se, but I guess that‘s part of the lesson itself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think the important lesson here is to realize that as hard as it is to accept, every other person's opinion and ideas are just as valid and carry just as much weight as yours. Just because someone disagrees with you does not make them your enemy. A lot of the time, in fact, both parties are both right and wrong. I have found in life that very seldom are people actually disagreeing when they think they are. A lot of the problem is in the delivery. If another person doesn't just nod their head or say, "You're right," then they must be disagreeing, even if their "counter-argument" actually goes hand in hand with your own. Being right doesn't mean everyone else is wrong, nor is everyone else being wrong a requirement for you to be right.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pride will always get in the way of important relationships. I don’t know if you've noticed, but people can in general spot a proud person a mile away, and we generally don't like proud people. Proud people are rude and insensitive; they refuse to accept any opinion or idea but their own, and usually don't have much meaning in life aside from money or career. We all talk about these people like they are someone else, and yet each and every person on the planet is overly proud of something. I know where my proud spots are. I'm not proud of them but I recognize that I have work to do. 100% of people who read this and think, "He's not talking to me," are completely and utterly wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How do we get rid of pride? This is the eternal question, because pride has been around since the beginning of time and will be around for a quite a while longer. Many religious groups have struggled with overcoming it, but as is apparent, it's still around. I don't claim to have any universal cure, but I do know some things that have worked for me:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Let someone else worry about what you want.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If everyone on the planet chose one or two people to please and took the time to give them what they want, then everyone on the planet would be satisfied. It's when people start to worry about whether or not they are going to get their way that the whole problem starts. If all we care about is our own way, then all we worry about is ourselves, and we become that proud person that I talked about earlier. My advice: pick someone to worry about and just do what they want, and let someone else worry about what you want. The chances are much more likely than not that there is someone who loves and cares for you enough to do this for you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Honestly consider others' opinions and ideas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Just because an idea or opinion isn't yours doesn't mean it can't be right or helpful. Just because someone does a task differently than you doesn't make them wrong, it just makes them different. Even if their way is a little less efficient than yours or seems to actually be more of a bother, maybe they do it that way for a reason that is personal to them. Basically, let people have the right to do things and think in their own personal way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Find some way every day to do something for someone that you don't have to.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So often we get caught up in what we are supposed to do that we forget that there are plenty of opportunities to brighten other peoples' days for the sake of making them happy. Way too often we only think of what reward we will gain from our service, and we lose sight of the whole purpose and spirit of service. If everyone went out of their way to do something nice for someone else every day, think of how much happier everyone would be. Think about how happy it makes you when someone goes out of their way to make you happy. It might help motivate you to do it yourself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In conclusion, just get over yourself and think more about others than you do about yourself. Believe me; you're not nearly as cool as you think you are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*DISCLAIMER: I fully realize that some people put on their pants from a sitting position, and therefore put both feet through at the same time; that is not the point that I am trying to make here. It's an expression, so don't give me crap for it. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Don’t Judge</title>
      <link>/blog/dont-judge</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You're not qualified, and even if you were, someone else already got the job</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stephen Covey wrote a book about habits that effective people have. In that book, he talks a lot about paradigm and compares a person's paradigm to a pair of colored glasses. He makes the point that the world looks a little bit different to a person with yellow lenses than it does to someone with red lenses. The first might look at an object and see that it's green, while the other sees purple. His point was directed in a little different direction than mine is, so I'll just leave the analogy at that and pick up with my part.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Too often in life we get stuck behind our personalized, colored paradigm goggles. Our entire lives have been spent crafting these spectacles of perspective, and everything that we were ever taught or experienced is melded into the workings. We were raised a certain way, so our lenses have a certain thickness. We had our heart broken and so the frames are a little bent in places. We took time to smell the roses one morning and installed bifocal lenses, and so on and so forth. Each of us sees the world and situations differently because of where we come from and those glasses that we've made for ourselves. The point I will attempt to make is that no matter how long and hard those two people with the yellow and red lenses argue about it, they'll never realize that the thing they're looking at is actually blue, not green or purple. Sometimes you have to take off the glasses and see what's actually there, not just what seems to be there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The French Impressionistic painters, including Claude Monet and Eduoard Manet, took a huge leap from the traditional art form when they started making their works of art. For so long, art had been focused on technical skill and exactness, and they saw the need to breathe new life into art in a way that had never been done before. Before the Impressionists, art was about representing actuality to the last detail. They point was to recreate reality on the canvas. The Impressionists didn't follow that form. They were all about painting what they were seeing, and not worrying about what it actually was. It didn't matter if the boat tied up to the dock didn't look exactly like a boat tied up to the dock, because to the Impressionist, it didn't look like a boat at the moment the painting was being done. Impressionistic painting is beautiful and inspiring, and frankly genius, but the moment we find ourselves in on of those paintings, so to speak, we'll run into problems. Reality and art are two very different things. The whole point of art has always been an attempt to recreate reality in an unreal situation. Paintings take moments of time and freeze them forever, but it is just an interpretation of a moment in time, not the moment itself. Songs try to capture human emotion and evoke it in others, but it still hasn't quite been mastered. Books and poetry try to use words to describe the indescribable. The point is everyone needs to see the line between perception and reality. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, there are those of a philosophical mind that would argue that reality is what we perceive it to be. To that argument I respond as follows:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many have, hoping to take on a certain air of philosophical genius, asked the following question. If a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, does it make a sound? Too often debates ensue for hours at a time about whether sound exists only because there are ears to hear it, and therefore in the absence of ears, there is no such thing as sound, and the physics of sound being a universal law. The answer, of course, can never be fully realized, because people are too stuck in their definitions of "sound". It's the same as asking me to tell you what color this chair is if I'm wearing yellow glasses and you're wearing red glasses. I'm always going to say that the chair is green, and you are always going to reject my opinion for the obvious reason that you see a purple chair. The only real way to answer the question is to take off the glasses and look at the chair.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are certain concepts in particular that I want to address specifically here. The first, and most important to me, is the concept of God. I use the term "concept" here very warily, as it doesn't convey my beliefs accurately. God has been the most debated idea or concept in the history of this earth. More wars have been fought over God than over anything else. There are still wars going on over God. Creeds have been created, churches have been set up, opposition has appeared, and the question still remains, is there a God? I will attempt to answer this question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the universe, outside of man's ability to control or fathom, there are distinct Truths. These Truths are the actualities of reality. There are countless numbers of these Truths, and sometimes we don't recognize them. For example, the earth revolves around the sun. For eons, people were so sure that the sun went around the earth, and there were many who were killed for supposing otherwise. This was also true about the earth being round. Yet, the earth is indeed round, and it does indeed revolve around the sun. These Truths are absolute and cannot be altered by any means that we have at our disposal. No amount of talking or rationalizing can change these universal facts. No matter what glasses you hide behind to say otherwise, the round earth is in actuality revolving around the sun. It is so.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With that same idea in mind, that there are certain Truths in the universe that reside separate in their own sphere of existence, influencing this one in which we live, but unable to be influenced by this one in which we live, we will pose the question again. Is there a God? The answer is either yes or no. There is no third option in this equation. There either is a God or there isn't. From these two answers spring other questions. Assuming the answer to the initial question is yes, that there is a God, questions arise like, "What is God?", "Is there a correct religion?", and the ever-present, "Why does God allow so much evil into the world?". From these questions come other questions and the tree of questions continues to grow and grow. Those questions, however, have either immense weight and meaning, or no meaning at all. If there is no God, there is no reason to ask why God allows bad things to happen. If there is a God, however, it is very important to know what God is and how It would be worshipped, if at all (is there a correct religion?). This tree of questions that arise or don't arise depending on the answer to the previous question points directly to the utter importance of the first question as a basis for all other questions on the matter. One cannot make conclusions about the answers to any of these questions in reverse order. The answer to the question, why does God allow evil in the world, does not answer the question of whether or not there is a God. One must first take off the glasses that cloud the ability to see the answer for what it is. That there is evil in the world also does not answer the question of whether there is a God. One must first find the answer to that initial question before embarking on any quests for answers to the later questions. Those will be answered by default as the first question is answered. But that first question must be answered, based on Truth, or the actuality of reality. One cannot simply decide that there is or isn't a God. One must find out the Truth. To avoid preaching, I will end there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another of the concepts that has been debated for centuries was alluded to in the previous paragraph. It is the concept of a correct religion. As was mentioned before, there are questions that need be answered even before this one is considered, but assuming that those questions have been answered in a manner that brings this question into importance, the answer is again, either yes or no. Just as with the existence of God, either there is a correct religion or there isn't. If there is, there are countless questions that follow, and if there isn't, life becomes quite simple and complex simultaneously. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are many more of these concepts that arise in everyday life, and to avoid attempting to exhaust that list here, I will conclude this line of reasoning with this comment. Asking the question, is there a God, requires at the basest level that the asker be willing to accept the answer for what it is, and not for what it seems to be. There is implication that those paradigm goggles be removed and the Truth be seen for what it really is, for Truth is something that can only be seen, not altered or stinted. Truth is how things actually are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The point is that too often we are caught up in what the world and our surroundings have taught us is real, and we forget to see the world as it really is. Truth is a beautiful thing; one need simply remove the spectacles of perspective and see it for the actuality of reality that it is.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>There are no fresh starts or do-over’s, just fresh resolve and do-better’s</title>
      <link>/blog/there-are-no-fresh-starts-or-do-overs-just-fresh-resolve-and-do-betters</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the New Year just past and everyone attempting to keep good on their new year’s resolutions, I think there is no better time for me to debut this little thought. I should preface this entire post with the fact that I have nothing against setting goals and I love the idea of setting resolutions for the New Year. I’m not advocating a change from that very worthwhile tradition, just a more accurate angle of approach.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Too often we look at setting goals and New Year’s resolutions as a “fresh start” or a chance to “do it over”. Because a new year is starting, this actually makes a lot of sense, because with a new year it seems as though everything starts over, and we’re given another chance. In fact, however, there are no such things as “fresh starts”. The fact of the matter is, life is one continuous round, and there is no way of “starting over” in the sense that all of the past just goes away and you are left with a completely clean slate. Even baptism is not a clean slate. It is true that God forgets and will not hold us accountable for our sins previous to baptism, but He doesn’t go back and remove them from the fabric of time, making it as thought they never happened. They are left so that we can effectively learn from them, having them constantly in our minds and memories.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Life is the sum of our experiences and actions. We may be proud of some, and not so proud of others, but we cannot and are not supposed to escape any of our past. The past creates the present. Remove any of the past, and the present ceases to be as we now know it. Remove any of the past, and we cease to exist as the people we are. We literally owe who and what we are to the past. My point here is that regardless of your past and situation, your past is not something to regret. It is who you are, and there is little that is more self-destructive than regretting yourself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, we have been given the present for the purpose of making the future something different than the past. The only way to change the past is to add positive experiences and choices to it. How do we do that? By utilizing the present to do and be what we want to be in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So what am I trying to say? There is no such thing as a fresh start or a do-over! All you can do is freshen your resolve and do better. Don’t try to replace the past, just improve the present.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Do, or do not; there is no try</title>
      <link>/blog/do-or-do-not-there-is-no-try</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’m sure there are very few of you who don’t know where this little line comes from. In fact, I think this may be among one of the most famous quotes of all time. I know it was very well known and very well used in our home, at least. Of course, that’s not the point that I’m getting at here. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think that many people misunderstand this quote, and although I don’t consider a fictional alien character from a sci-fi movie to be the best source of wisdom for life, I think there is a lesson here for everyone. Many people take this quote to mean that there really is no such thing as trying, because you will either succeed or fail at every endeavor that you undertake. So when Yoda tells Luke this, it seems like he is telling him to have confidence and just succeed, instead of doubting his own abilities. I think there is a lot of merit to this, but I also think there is a deeper message here, one that can apply to everyone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What I believe Yoda was trying to tell Luke is that Luke already had all of the power and skills inside of him, and all he really needed to do was just do it. He already had the ability and power to get that ship out of the swamp; he just didn’t believe in himself, and therefore had to “try” to do so. Yoda was disappointed in Luke because Luke thought that the ship was too big and therefore he wasn’t strong enough to lift it out of the water. His own mind was his worst enemy, as was shown by the ever-confusing incident where Luke kills Darth Vader only to find that the man in the suit was himself. Anyway, I’m getting side-tracked here.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’ll permit me one more sci-fi reference, I promise I’ll bring this whole thing back into real life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A less well known, and yet just as powerful quote concerning this idea comes from the first Matrix movie. Neo is being trained by Morpheus, and is told, “Stop trying to hit me and just hit me!” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this instance, just as with Yoda and Luke, Morpheus is trying to teach Neo that he has all of the abilities that he needs. Neo, of course, doesn’t really catch on to this concept until the end of the movie, but once he rids himself of his inhibitions and just acts, he realizes that there is nothing he can’t do. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Luke, by the same token, does not become a real Jedi until he lets go of his fears and self-inflicted restrictions and rids himself of the notion that he “can’t” do something. That is the point where both heroes begin to realize their full potential.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ok I apologize for that, but I think it does a good job of illustrating my point. In life, too many times we try to do things that we are already perfectly capable of doing. Sometimes we try and be a different person than we are, only to find out that we already are the person that we’re trying to be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stop trying and just do or don’t. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s my point. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Do or don’t do, there is no try.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>So what’s wrong with being sheltered again?</title>
      <link>/blog/so-whats-wrong-with-being-sheltered-again</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I spent a good deal of time after I got back from Ukraine feeling very superior to everyone I met because I felt like I had “experience” of some kind. It seemed like everyone else I met was so stuck in their little bubble that they couldn’t see that there were other thoughts and ways of doing things. I think the biggest mistake I made was justifying my actions by telling people that they didn’t really know what “bad” was, because they hadn’t seen what I’d seen. If only I’d understood then what I am coming to understand now. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have seen a lot of things that I now wish I hadn’t. I’ve done a lot of things that I wish I hadn’t needed to do. I know things and have experienced things that have certainly made me more aware of the world and how things work in some places, but they have done nothing to make me a better person. They certainly haven’t made me any better than any other person I come in contact with, regardless of whether or not they’re more or less “experienced” than I am. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Contrary to my own previous opinion and what is now fairly popular opinion, being sheltered is not ignorance, it’s innocence. At the end of the day, the most valued characteristic in humanity is just that, innocence. Being untainted by the world and all of the bad that’s out there, and just being pure and beautiful. I wish I could say that I was like that. I have to spend the rest of my life making sense of and filtering out all of the crap I’ve seen and done. I have an immense love and admiration for people who have been privileged to keep themselves sheltered from the garbage in the world, and most of that stems from honest envy. So again I ask the question, what’s wrong with being sheltered? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*Please do not misconstrue this as an attack on those with more “experience”. This is purely a defense of the sheltered (innocent). </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>They call me amateur,Who, from lofty perch of minded tradition
Portray well the way of the ancients and
Continue on as is the expectation.
With citation of Byron and quotation of Shakespeare
Flowing, eloquent, rehearsed and delivered,
Bely they the foundation
Upon which rest all thought to which they claim ownership.</p>
<p>I must confess,
I do not share their understanding and knowledge.
Nor do I claim to hold even a match-light to the passionate flame of Byron.
I do not bend to my will my native tongue
With near the strength of mighty Shakespeare.</p>
<p>But this is not what I wish to do.</p>
<p>They call me amateur,
And yet I do what all whom they revere have done.
I need not Byron to feel passion.
I need not Shakespeare to speak my heart.
I need but a pen and a thought,
And the world my voice shall hear.</p>
<p>My voice the world shall hear,
Not that of other men.</p>
<p>The pens of yore, though good and well,
Can tell no tales of where I dwell.
My life, my love, this small crusade,
Can by me, only, be portrayed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember that people who are driving slowly in front of you are actually driving more legally than you are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember that the faults you see in others are usually the things that you need to work on most.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember that waiting to let a long line of people or cars go before you go just lets them get to where they’re going a little bit faster.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember that holding the door open for a long line of people just saves them the hassle of having to open it themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember that people who talk incessantly about themselves aren’t very confidant and they are asking you to help them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember that long lines are full of people just like you with reasons just like yours for why they’d like the line to be shorter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember that all going out of your way to compliment or encourage someone does is make their day better.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember that rush-hour traffic is full of people just like you with reasons just like yours for why traffic should move faster.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember that being frustrated by something or someone doesn’t make you right.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember that taking offense when offence is not intended only makes you a fool.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember that taking offence when offence is intended only makes you a bigger fool.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember that today might be the last chance you have to say I love you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember that you aren’t always right.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember humility.</span></p>

      <title>The “Fantasy World” of popular media</title>
      <link>/blog/the-fantasy-world-of-popular-media</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Josh Gwynn brought up an interesting question one day while we were serving together in Ukraine, and I’ve thought a lot about it since. I was reminded of it today in Sunday school, so here it is:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Elder Gwynn was a much younger missionary, and so he had been in the States much more recently than I had, and therefore had a better idea of what “popular culture” was like. Because of this, and also because I was nearing the end of my mission, I would sometimes have him tell me the plot to movies that had come out since I had been in Ukraine. He would then give me a 5-minute condensation of the movie, and I would feel more “connected” with America. Looking back, it was pretty ridiculous, but everyone gets a little crazy towards the end. Anyway, there is a point to all of this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the movies that we talked about was the latest remake of Superman. Elder Gwynn told me that he was so disappointed in that movie because Superman is supposed to be the epitome of moral, clean living (at least according to the original embodiment of the character), and the premise of this movie is that he had fornicated with Louis Lane and they had a child together. We talked about that for a while and then an interesting thought came to me that you’ll see turns into the basis of this idea that I’m talking about. I’m going to digress a touch but this will come full circle, I promise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We, as a media-driven society, have given an enormous amount of power and freedom of creation to the artists that drive the media. Authors, film-makers, even musicians to some extent have the freedom to create whatever they want. The unfortunate consequence of this is that they are allowed to create universes and worlds with morals that they themselves determine and understandings of right and wrong that they themselves dictate. For example, in the Ocean’s 12 trilogy, the antagonists and the protagonists seem to have switched roles. In that universe, it is the thief who is in the right, and the law that is in the wrong. The movies are very entertaining, and the main characters very charming, and so they artfully cover up the fact that the good guys are felons! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the same way, one of the most popular and what is widely accepted as the best-made series of movies of all time is the Godfather trilogy. Again, this entire movie is about the mafia. We watch these movies and the whole time we want the gangsters to end up winning in the end. And yet because it is such good acting, we never seem to realize that fact. We would never want these people anywhere near our children, and yet we bring them right into our living rooms.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I could go on and on with examples, but I don’t think I need to. What I told Elder Gwynn was that because the writer of that film was even writing about Superman, he was writing God and morality right out of that world with it. Based on that principle, Superman didn’t act immorally because he doesn’t exist in the same reality as morals and God do. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s the danger of the media, and that is where the “fantasy” comes into play. So often when we think of the word fantasy we think of fantasizing, or making up fantastic (fairy tale) stories in our heads. The reality is that all of these fake existences that movies and books can invent create a fantasy universe that so many people try to accept as reality. There are countless movies where the husband or wife is applauded in the end for leaving his/her spouse in the name of “true love” with someone else. And at the end of the movie, we’re happy for them because they’re finally with the one they truly love. That might be ok in the fictional place where those characters exist, but it is not ok in this one. Being a criminal might be ok and even glamorous in the above mentioned movies, but it is not ok in reality.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The caution is this: Be very careful not only what you believe from the movies, but what you watch at all. The movie or book might have a great message, but if it gets you one little step closer to actually believing all of the crap that was thrown in there just to get that “good message” across, then you’ve already lost a chunk of your touch with reality. Almost every movie these days has a scene in it with some form of fornication or adultery. Every time you watch that, your mind accepts that situation a little more. Don’t risk it. The only way to keep in touch with real reality is to stay away from fake reality. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let your moral standards be fixed and immovable. If you believe in marital fidelity (this includes premarital abstinence), don’t watch movies that even suggest infidelity. If you do, sooner or later you will no longer believe in marital fidelity. If you believe in being an upstanding citizen of your country, do not watch movies that suggest criminal behavior to be moral. If you do, sooner or later you will lose your belief in citizenship. If you believe in God, be very, very careful about watching movies that suggest that He does not exist, or sooner or later you will lose that belief as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Do not get stuck in fantasy worlds. Remember to separate fiction from reality, and let real reality be your reality.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Discipline</title>
      <link>/blog/discipline</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A few weeks or so ago I decided to start a new set of goals and plans so that my Summer would be productive and satisfying. I decided on exercise, eating, reading, cleaning, and all other types of goals you can think of. I thought about how we needed to develop the discipline to get everything done every day so that when the Fall semester rolls around again, I will have made those good habits and they will stick.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I got to thinking about that, and I realized something very interesting. So often, we think of discipline as having the strength to say no in the face of temptation. (Temptation in this instance refers to anything that could go against any of our goals.) We think of all of the things we shouldn’t be doing, and develop the strength to not do them. We think of developing discipline as saving up strength to resist in those times of need. That means that discipline is a power to prevent. I realized, however, that it is something else entirely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I believe that real discipline is having the ability to do, not just refrain from doing. Instead of just being able to say no to the bad things, discipline is how we say yes to the good things. I believe that real discipline is getting up every morning and making decisions that will put the actions of that day right where we need them. Discipline is taking positive control over one’s life, and doing all of the right things without even taking notice of all of the things one shouldn’t be doing. If a person focuses only on what should happen, and simply does those things, then there is no room for idleness, and therefore no room for temptation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My simple point is that instead of focusing our disciplinary efforts on preventing bad, use that energy to actively choose the things that need to happen. Make positive, disciplined choices that will only lead you into situations where you are proactively reaching your goals, and then you don’t even have to waste your time thinking about all the bad that could happen.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>I Dare You</title>
      <link>/blog/i-dare-you</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you find yourself reading this post for whatever reason, I want you to know that I’m talking directly at you. This is a message for everyone collectively, but I am directing this more specifically at you. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that I’m referring to a specific person when I say that, because I am literally talking right at you. This is my challenge, in the form of a dare. Take it seriously, because I mean it that way:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to give up your sense of entitlement and realize that you don’t deserve anything.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to stop whining and complaining about your life and realize everything that you have.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to stop whining and complaining that things don’t work out perfectly for you every time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to stop whining and complaining about your family.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to stop whining and complaining about your parents.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to stop whining and complaining about your spouse.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to stop whining and complaining about your kids.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to stop whining and complaining about your job, or lack thereof.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to stop whining and complaining about school.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to stop whining and complaining. Period.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to accept that just because things don’t always go in your favor doesn’t make the system unfair.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to realize that you are wrong more than you’re right.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to not get defensive and prickly when someone points out that you could improve.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to accept the rules and regulations of any institution, be it educational, legal, legislative, religious, or anything else, as being simply the rules and regulations of that system, and just because you don’t agree or they aren’t perfectly convenient for you doesn’t make them wrong, corrupt, unjust, or worthy of hostilities.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to be happy instead of cynical.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to count your blessings instead of woe-is-me-ing all the time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to be optimistic instead of realistic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to be better instead of enough.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dare you to be positive instead of blunt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most of all, I dare you to realize your own fallibility and tendency toward error, and accept it. Nobody is expected to be perfect because nobody is able to be perfect, including you. There are people who complain about their children, and there are people that are grateful that their children survived past infanthood, and still others who would give just about anything just to be able to have children. There are those who complain about some practices and policies of their place of education, and then there are the little old ladies in third world countries that have to work selling sunflower seeds and dried black beans on the side of the road because their government’s pension isn’t enough for a small dog to live off of who pay tithing so that person can attend an outstanding school for less than half of most in-state tuition is. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stop complaining.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Be grateful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The end.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="s1">I have a little catching up to do on my writing here, so these next few posts might come rapid-fire. I would apologize, but close to nobody reads this anyway so what difference does it make, right?</span>
<span class="s1">One thing I’ve thought a lot about over the years is the concept of writing in pen versus writing in pencil. Let me explain. No, there is too much, let me sum up:</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">For a long time, I was of the opinion that it was better to write in pencil, because that way you can erase any mistakes that you make, and you don’t end up with a messy sheet of paper with scribbles and scratched-out mistakes. When you write in pencil, you have the ability, and the option, to get rid of any evidence that you wrote anything at all, and really gives you a back door to deny having had anything to do with whatever it was. So essentially you can either have a clean slate with nothing on the page, or at least you can have a neat-looking set of writings that is essentially your final draft.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">I spent a lot of time thinking about how that can apply to real life. For example, instead of going all out with a particular idea, like a new business or project, and throwing all of your resources into one effort, it can be better to be cautious with how much you invest in one particular thing; if that particular project or business totally tanks, you can still pull out and “erase” the mistake, since you haven’t put too much of your effort and time into it. In other words, if you write lightly in pencil, and what you’re trying to write turns out to be totally worthless, you can just erase it, and nobody will be the wiser.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">I thought a lot about that, and then realized how incredible boring and lifeless that philosophy is. There is no room for real improvement or growth with that ideology. If you spent your whole life walking around on eggshells so you can’t possible have a bad mark on your record, you’ll never have any good marks on it either. My new philosophy is as follows: Do everything you do on purpose, in other words, write in pen.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">When I was a young piano student, one of the most often repeated pieces of advice from all of my teachers was to “make mistakes proudly,” meaning to not be timid about the parts of particular pieces that I wasn’t particularly sure of or confident in, and just play through it. When you make mistakes, but play so softly that you can’t really hear them, you will just keep playing the wrong notes and never fix them. You can avoid being told that you played wrong notes in practice or with your teacher, but the unfortunate thing is always that you will play the wrong notes in the performance. It’s much better to play wrong notes proudly in practice than to play wrong notes in the performance. That way you can learn from your mistakes and do better in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">I think it is very important to consciously decide our own actions and then take personal responsibility for the consequences of our actions. Instead of walking around and hoping that the wind will whisk us into the right path or whatever the idea may be, we should make conscious decisions to do things of our own free will. If you write in pen, to sum up the analogy, you won’t be able to erase your mistakes, but you will be able to really learn from them. Don’t timidly try things out. Just go out and do things on purpose. Do everything as though it was on purpose.</span></p>

      <title>Easier said than done</title>
      <link>/blog/easier-said-than-done</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I came to a shocking realization this morning, and it has a lot to do with a slight misunderstanding of that phrase, “easier said than done.” I think I’ve spent my whole life taking the easy way out. Let me explain:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before this morning, I thought that the point of that phrase, “easier said than done,'” was focused on explaining one’s inability to perform or difficulty in performing an action by pointing out the relative difficulty of performing that task to giving it. It was an excuse, for all intents and purposes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, this morning, I came to this startling realization. I had been applying this phrase to my life, but in a little bit different of a way. Instead of making the excuse that something was harder to do than to say, I was simply making the excuse that since I was saying it, I need not be concerned too much with actually doing it. I’ve had the attitude for too long that writing in this blog about a certain topic not only makes me an expert on that topic, but also infers that I am already doing everything that I write about.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take, for example, the post that I wrote about just doing, not trying. I wrote that with all the idealist zeal of an intellectual, and yet I continue to demand that people who are disappointed in my continued inability to perform a certain task at least give me credit for trying. If I can’t live it, what right do I have to write it? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What I mean when I say that I’ve spent my whole life taking the easy way out is this: It is much easier to talk about doing something than to actually do it, and most of the time, the more you talk about something, the less you are actually doing it. At least that is the case with me. I’ve been taking the easy way out by talking about all of the things that I want to be doing, instead of just doing them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’m not going to say anything by way of grandstanding promises, because words mean nothing. What I will do, or at least what my new goal will be, is actively refrain from writing about anything that I haven’t tried, tested, perfected, and truly come to understand for myself personally. I think that’s probably fair. That way I’m not plagiarizing a principle, but recounting experience.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Respect for Women (a diatribe)</title>
      <link>/blog/respect-for-women-a-diatribe</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recent events have gotten me thinking about a lot of the things that I think are seriously wrong with modern society, and I want to start listing them. There are a couple of people that will think that I wrote this aimed directly at them, but never fear, this has been on my mind for a lot longer than just today. This diatribe is directed at all people, everywhere.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ve come to the conclusion that our society has completely lost its sense of respect in general, but most blatantly (and most disgustingly), its respect for women. I cannot believe the kinds of things that are permitted and sometimes encouraged to be said to women these days. It’s simply revolting. And the worst part is, the demeaning things that people say tend to pale in comparison to the ridiculously demeaning things that society has done to women in the past 50 years. Let me just go on a little rant about it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Women have been turned into objects. It is so blatantly obvious what society thinks of women and what they are ‘good for’. Women are seen primarily as objects of sexual gratification, tools for men and even other women to achieve some sort of release. Men don’t ever talk about women in terms of their truly important characteristics, like grace, character, integrity, or fidelity. Instead all we ever hear is talk of their purely physical, purely temporary attributes, such as hotness, sexiness, breast size, shape of their buttocks, and worst of all, their potential to be a good sexual partner! What the crap is wrong with us?! Women are more than their bodies! Women are people. Human beings. In many cases, women are more human than men are, and yet the media with all its unchecked influence has portrayed women as having the sole function of pleasing men sexually and culinarily (but mostly sexually). As such, men (and women) have come to believe that they are in fact dominant, and women are meant only for their pleasure. Teenage boyfriends are expecting sex after 4 or 5 dates, and among adults the third date is almost always when the sexuality rounds third base and heads for home. The worst part is that when those women refuse to ‘put out’, they are demeaned even more and treated as though they are in the wrong! What the crap is that?! Women are not meant to be the playthings of the over-excited.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the other end of the spectrum, to add insult to injury, are the places where hard-working women have to fend off inferences and struggle for their dignity. Women in the workplace are treated like garbage, and for that reason alone, women in the workplace are some of the most hardened people out there. They have to be, because there is no other way for them to survive. It is a hard-wired fact in our country that it is an embarrassment for a man to be out-done by a woman at anything, and so men have to preemptively strike to avoid the possibility of embarrassment. And the worst thing is when a man is shown up by a woman anyway. Suddenly he must save face. Suddenly the woman is an enemy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I see it every day, all around me. The students I interact with all the time all share these same tendencies. Women are simply seen as less than men, and it’s ridiculous. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bottom line: What happened to the days when everyone stood up when a woman walked in a room? I’m not saying we should go back to the old fashioned way of doing things, but holding doors and being polite are just common courtesies that I thought were taught back in kindergarten. Our modern society needs to get a grip on itself and show some respect to women. It needs more men that are willing to stand up for women and fight their cause. It needs more women to stand up and realize their true worth and live accordingly. And the absolute bottom line is this:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If I ever see anyone disrespect a woman in public for any reason whatsoever, I will get involved.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Honest vs. Abrasive (a diatribe on Facebook)</title>
      <link>/blog/honest-vs-abrasive-a-diatribe-on-facebook</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’m not on very good terms with Facebook right now. I believe that it has single-handedly (or cyber-handedly, if you prefer) taken all conversational etiquette right out of our society. There is not one shred of the politeness that I have now come to really appreciate when I do actually encounter it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Back story:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I posted the following as my status on Facebook about a month ago:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Watched "Everything is Illuminated" tonight. Amazing flick. You probably would have to understand Russian and English, and have lived in Ukraine to really get it, though, which is kinda sad, but at the same time, awesome. Incredible show.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Notice how I didn’t ask for comments. I was very obviously just making a comment about what I thought was a good movie. Almost immediately I started getting responses. The first couple were in affirmation of what I said, although one made a comment about being able to understand the movie even without speaking Russian or living in Ukraine (which is totally bogus, btw). Then an incredibly horrid thing started happening. I started receiving comments about how people disagreed with what I was saying. Where I come from, unless someone is asking for a critique or a response, if you don’t agree with what they’re saying, YOU DON’T SAY ANYTHING!! You just politely decline to comment, because it doesn’t really matter if you agree or disagree. It’s not a debate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I blame Facebook. I think all this cyber-communication has made it too easy to be abrasively blunt and call it “honesty”. I still believe in politeness. It’s ok for someone else to think differently than you, and it’s also ok for you NOT to make comments in direct contradiction of what someone else thinks just because you disagree. Sometimes people are asking for comment (i.e. this blog has a standing invitation for comment) whether implicitly or explicitly, but unless you absolutely know that, just chill your bones and let it slide.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That being said, I want to invite any reader to comment on what they think the difference between being honest and being abrasive is, and which you do/prefer.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Purism, Elitism, and Pure Stupidity</title>
      <link>/blog/purism-elitism-and-pure-stupidity</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I want to try and stay away from too much diatribing; I want to have a lot of momentum when I really need it down the road ;)That being said, I wanted to bring up another question that I have been toying with in my head for a while. I think the title of this post not only gives away a good portion of the question, but also my personal stance, but I want to talk for a second about it and then see what you all think.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So I was playing volleyball tonight, and one of the girls showed one of the most elitist and purist attitudes that I’ve seen in a long time, and I’ve played volleyball with the elitistest of the elitist. We had 7 people, and we decided to play doubles king of the court, to make the game a little more interesting. That was fun for a while, and then a couple more people showed up, and we could then play 5 on 4, which is a fine number of people in my opinion. She felt differently, which was fine, but she didn’t just express that opinion, but continued to complain about it as we started playing. Then , when one of the people had to leave, we had even 4’s, and she looked around at her team, and with an unmistakable look of disdain at the team she was left with, just walked off the court and left. I thought to myself, that’s fine if she had to leave, but it looked a lot to me like she just didn’t want to play with people who “weren’t as good as she” was. (note: She’s not really that good of a player).So here’s my question. In this situation, do you think that kind of elitist attitude is justified? Or in any kind of similar situation, do you feel justified in declining to participate in some activity because of the seeming lack of qualifications of the other participants?</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Homosexuality as a Physical Characteristic</title>
      <link>/blog/homosexuality-as-a-physical-characteristic</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Introduction</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There is great confusion in the Latter-day Saint community surrounding and dealing with the issue of homosexuality and same-sex marriage. We have been instructed by our leaders that homosexuality is wrong and that we should support any proposition in defending marriage as being between a man and a woman. When this instruction was first given, I had serious doubts and troubles justifying this to myself. I could not justify that with what I knew concerning the equal protection clause of the 14</span><span class="s2"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="s1"> Amendment. It wasn’t until I understood certain facts about truth and homosexuality that it became clear to me why this is the case. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I will not attempt simply to defend the church's stance on homosexuality and same-sex marriage in this paper. The legalization of homosexual marriage is an entirely separate topic which I will not try to defend or reject. That is a topic for another debate or paper at a different time. My purpose is instead to enlighten the reader as to why we believe and have been directed in this way and clear up the confusion surrounding the origin of homosexuality. I believe there are many who do not truly understand the facts about homosexuality. Many critics and even some church members falsely accuse the church of bigotry towards a growing population of homosexuals in our society. This is because of misunderstanding church members act and speak in an unauthorized representation of church policy and the actual doctrine. I hope to show that accusation of bigotry to be completely false by presenting the metaphysical relationship between the spirit and the body and how that plays a key role in the entire question of homosexuality, as well as help the reader to understand how we have been doctrinally directed to act and relate to homosexuals.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>A Question of Origin</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b> </b>The first item to discuss is the very question of the origin of homosexuality. Many in the church claim that it is merely a choice, and that those who consider themselves homosexual simply decided that they want to live that lifestyle. As a rule, this argument lacks fundamental and basic knowledge of how the body works and the role that emotions play in the physical characteristics of a person. It is possible, however, that there are those who are simply attracted to the homosexual lifestyle who choose to take it up simply for that reason. To discount that possibility would be foolish; to consider it the general rule would be equally as foolish. There are others who believe that homosexuality is a result of a particular type of upbringing. It will be shown, however, that while upbringing can certainly influence a person's sexual preferences, this by itself is most likely not the sole cause or reason for a person's sexuality to be affected in such a drastic way. The opinion of the vast majority of proponents of homosexuality is stated succinctly in the phrase, "I was born this way." I believe that the fact that this argument is used by so many pro-gay activists is the reason that many in the church disregard it as impossible. However, I will show that this is in fact a very likely cause of homosexuality. I will show that same-gender attraction is a real physical characteristic, and as such it should be given the respect deserved of it. I believe it important to note that I do not use the term "cause" when referring to homosexuality in the same context that one would refer to the "cause" of a crime, disaster, or disease. I do not wish to demean homosexuality in any way, and so I use "cause" to simply mean the origin of those feelings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Relationship between Spirit and Physical Body</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In order to further discuss this question, we must consider the fact that there is more to our physical makeup than we sometimes consider. In the church we are constantly reminded that our bodies house our spirits, and most of the focus of these discussions is on the spirit, and not the body. I will attempt to give each part of what constituted our physical, spiritual, and Intelligent makeup equal weight in the discussion of homosexuality.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are three different parts of what we know as our bodies, two of which are less known and one of which is very seldom known or talked about. One of them is obvious, it is our physical body. This is the part of us that can feel the pain of a cut or a burn, or the tingle of a cold shower. Our eyes are what see the world around us and our ears are what hear it. Our body is the medium through which we interact with others and it is a tool that we use while here on this earth. Contrary to very popular belief, our body does not constitute "us". Our body is merely the casing for the other parts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The second part of us is our spirit. Our spirit bodies are much like our physical bodies, except that instead of being made of physical matter, they are made of spiritual matter. We don't know much about the physics of spirit matter, except that it has the ability to enter physical matter and control its actions. Our spirit bodies look just like our physical bodies, or rather; our physical bodies become what they become in large part because of our spirit bodies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The third part, however, is what actually “us” is. It is called Intelligence, or Essence. Just as spiritual matter inhabits and controls physical matter, Intelligence is housed in spiritual matter, and is what controls the spirit, and therefore the body. The brain is like the cockpit to our body. Without it, we can't control our body, but the cockpit doesn't control the plane without a pilot. Our minds are not the result of firings of neurons and brain function, although our brains are vital to the controlling of our body. What is "us" therefore, is a part of us that is neither physical nor spiritual. That is how we can still be us after we die, and how people are able to have out-of-body experiences and realize that they are having them. Our brain does not house us, for we are made of much higher stuff. For purposes of this paper, I will refer to the spirit and Intelligence together, as “spirit”.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Homosexuality as a Physical Characteristic</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Given the distinction between the physical and the spiritual, it is necessary to discuss which human traits originate in the spiritual and which originate in the physical. It is important to recognize that while the spirit has control over the body and its actions, the body still influences the spirit in many ways. This creates a conglomeration of spiritual and physical characteristics that make up each person's individual being. For example, gender originates in the spirit. Our physical gender is a direct result of the influencing power of our spirits in the development of our bodies. Also, identity originates in the spirit. Who we are is not a result of where we were born or how we were raised. Instead we have a pre-mortal identity that transcends time and space.</span> <span class="s1"> In general, characteristics that would apply on a spiritual level originate there, whereas things that do not apply on the spiritual level originate in the physical. A prime example of this is our preferences regarding food. Physical nourishment is something that is purely that, physical. When we eat food, it is not our spirits but our bodies that even realize that it is occurring. Therefore, which foods we prefer is a matter that comes from our body's physical responses to the types of foods we eat. So, the preference of chocolate to vanilla ice cream is a result of a person's physical makeup, and has little to do with, and is virtually un-influenced by, the spirit. These are the characteristics about which we say, "I was born that way," or, "That's how my mother raised me." To enumerate more examples, fashion sense, hairstyle preference, sport of choice, climate preference and musical taste are primarily physical characteristics. Along with these <i>preferences</i>, and most other preferences relating to the world we live in, is the sexual preference of members of the same gender – homosexuality.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Although it is much deeper rooted and much more difficult to reverse, same-gender attraction is basically the same as preference of chocolate to vanilla ice cream or a preference of vegetarianism. To illustrate, I have loved ice cream since I was a child, and that love is most likely a result of my dad and older brothers always eating it. So my love for ice cream was a learned or acquired preference. However, my preference of vanilla to chocolate in most cases is a result of the taste centers in my brain requiring a specific message from my taste buds in order for the endorphins to be released to give me the physically pleasing sensation involved in eating vanilla ice cream. I have since trained my brain to accept chocolate ice cream as well, but it is still does not quite produce the same effect. In this same way, there are those whose brains release those pleasure chemicals in response to a specific message from the sensory organs indicating another of their same sex. In the same way that my brain releases the correct pleasures when I eat vanilla ice cream as opposed to chocolate, some brains are pleased with associating romantically and intimately with members of the same sex.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At this point I will address some important things that may seem to contradict my arguments. Current accepted psychological authorities attribute homosexuality to the human psyche and consider it a psychological preference, not a physical preference. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has stated "some people believe that sexual orientation is innate and fixed; however, sexual orientation develops across a person’s lifetime". Also, a report from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health states: "For some people, sexual orientation is continuous and fixed throughout their lives. For others, sexual orientation may be fluid and change over time". The APA has also said, “most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation," and in a joint statement with other major American medical organizations, the APA has stated, "different people realize at different points in their lives that they are heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or bisexual". This assessment of homosexuality is valid based on current understanding of the human mind. For the psychological world, the mind is centered in the brain, and is a part of the physical body. The reason for this is a lack of understanding of the true nature of the body, particularly the mind. Therefore, this understanding of homosexuality is only valid when the spirit, body, and intelligence are considered together as one entity. Due to the fact that most psychological organizations today do consider them together as one entity, they are correct in their assumptions, but in light of a deeper understanding of the relationship between spirit and body which I have presented, that assumption is not universally valid. To gain a deeper and more correct understanding of the actuality of the situation, one must take into consideration the difference between the brain (body), and the spirit (and intelligence). The idea that science has yet to fully realize the deeper truth about a subject is not new. For centuries, scientists have discovered deeper truths about everything from molecular structure to evolutionary biology. What begins as a general understanding that can be applicable most of the time becomes a more specific rule or law that has applicability in almost all cases. As understanding becomes more specific, the rules and laws are applied with correct specificity, and there are less and less exceptions to the laws and rules. In a later section of this paper, I will deal more with this idea, and that section should help to clear up any confusion.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Acting on Homosexual Feelings: Spirit vs. Body</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Inherent in the differences between the spiritual and the physical is the realization of the origin of the force of will. Given that the body is controlled by the spirit and Intelligence, it follows that Intelligence and spirit direct the actions of the body. As was stated earlier, I will refer to Intelligence and spirit together simply as spirit.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For this section of the paper, I will refer to thought directed action and instinct directed action. To clarify, thought directed action is action that originates from logic or reasoning and defies the instinctive action, which is based mainly on natural, carnal instinct, not on thought or logical reasoning. Thought directed instinct originates from Intelligence, while instinct directed action originates in the body.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thought directed action by definition is in direct competition with natural instinct. It is the natural, physical instinct of a person to avoid pain at all costs, and flee when harmed. However, bodybuilders continue to fight through the pain, Special Forces operatives train to withstand torture, and people everywhere sit quietly through uncomfortable dentist appointments. This principle is better known as the "mind over matter" principle, and many people have come to realize that what a person's body tells them to do does not necessarily have to be what they choose to do. This is because thought occurs in the spirit by way of Intelligence and not the brain or body itself. Even when the body is telling the spirit that it needs or wants something, the spirit has the freedom and the power to decide whether it will obey the body's request.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Instinct directed action comes from the opposite side. Instinct is the physical body's natural reaction to various stimuli, and in most instances these reactions are centered around avoiding pain or gaining pleasure. Succumbing fully to instinct usually results in very primal, animal-like behavior. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is important to reiterate the fact that even when instinct is very strongly suggesting a certain action, the spirit always has the choice to obey or not to obey. When I burn my hand on the stove, instinct tells me to instantly remove my hand and run it under cold water, but my spirit still has the power to choose whether or not to move it. Pain is a physical reaction between the hot stove and my now melting skin that sends an urgent message to the brain to quite clearly point out that something very harmful is occurring. This does not require a response, however, because the spirit still has the power to override the instinctual response. Another good indication of this is the chilling phenomenon when evil spirits possess a body. The Bible has many documented instances of such “possession” and in each case, the person was unable to make his/her own decisions because the evil spirits had taken control of the body. This simply supports the principle that there is power given to spiritual beings to inhabit and control physical bodies, and that the spiritual being has an inherent power over the actual physical body. "Mind over matter" simply means "spirit controls body". </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This principle is applied in the case of homosexuality in the same way it applies to the examples given. Regardless of the strength of the physical, homosexual feelings, the spirit has the power to choose to act or not to act on those feelings. Our spirits were given dominion over the flesh precisely for this reason. There are many elements of the physical experience that we are to overcome while here in the flesh. For some, it is a struggle with drugs or alcohol, for others, pornography. For many, the struggle is with an attraction to members of the same gender. Again, it is important to reiterate that these homosexual attractions originate in the body, not the spirit, and the spirit does have the power given to it to make decisions contrary to the physical nature of the body it governs. However, of all the struggles to be allotted to a person, I would suggest that a physical, sexual attraction to members of the same sex would be among the most difficult to deal with. This does not excuse acting on those feelings in a way contrary to the laws of God, but it does give members of the church a better idea of why they should not judge these people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Conclusion</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b> </b>The information presented has shown homosexuality to be more than just a psychological or mental characteristic, but as an actual physical characteristic that influences a person’s desires and actions. Not taking into consideration the laws regarding adultery that have been set in place since the beginning of time, it is very important for all people, and especially those who believe homosexual action to be wrong, to understand and respect the reality of homosexuality. The law in place specifically forbids homosexual conduct of any kind, but there are equally important laws requiring men and women to love their neighbors and not judge others, to which every person is equally subjected. This means that members of the church should not only not hate or judge homosexuals, but should respect them and their particular situation and the difficulty thereof. At the same time, the information that has been presented here rejects any claim of general bigotry on the part of the church and its members based only on the position of the church on this particular issue. The church is completely justified in opposing homosexuality, and therefore same-sex marriage, even without considering secular or legal reasoning, based simply on certain truths that have been presented regarding the body and the spirit and how that information relates the eternal laws regarding human sexuality.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Vindication, philosophically speaking</title>
      <link>/blog/vindication-philosophically-speaking</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today has been a good day for philosophy and me. Over the past few weeks, our relationship has been pretty rocky, but there have been a few really good days that have made it worth it. Today has become a sort of day of vindication for the whole idea of me as a philosophy major. That of course doesn't mean that I love everything about philosophy or even agree with what's being taught. I just feel serious confirmation that I'm in the right place, studying in a field that I now realize I was born and bred for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let me explain. No, there is too much. Let me sum up:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My frustration with philosophy, at least my most recent frustration with it, has been that my philosophy courses are seriously kicking my trash. I swear, there have never been classes where I honestly felt like no matter how hard I studied, I still wouldn't fully comprehend the material. (History tells us that I just didn't study at all). Its incredibly frustrating to never have taken a class where halfway through it, you still have trouble explaining to people what you're studying in the class. I'm a fairly intelligent individual, at least intelligent enough to understand the basic concept of a class (or just fake it), but in this case, I find myself unable to do either. Part of it may come from the fact that for most of my education up to this point, the material in any given class has been such that I could to some extent derive the basic understanding from something that I'd already learned. In other words, if I added all of my other learning together, and made some deductions, I could usually come up with whatever we were talking about in the class.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have officially reached the end of such derivations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But enough about my frustrations. I have some thoughts brewing about the parallel between Plato's allegory and my situation, but those are thoughts for another time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My vindication came today at 2 separate times, in similar ways:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Back story:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In high school, among a lot of other things that I thought about, I had a particular thought that many of you will find familiar. I want to preface this by saying that the first time I ever read anything by Rene Descartes was here at BYU, way after high school. My thought was this:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Suppose I were to retract my thoughts back away from the physical world, away from touch, sight, smell, and other sensory experience. Suppose I were to retract so far into myself that I would not even interact with my own brain. Suppose I were to retract so far away from everything physical that I would suddenly be observing the physical world from outside the physical world. Needless to say, I supposed this, and then I came to the following, startling idea. What if, instead of a spirit inside of a physical body, interacting with a physical world that actually subsists, I in fact am simply my internal thoughts and feelings, and the physical world is nothing more than a complicated virtual reality, designed to test my innermost feelings and desires and providing for every possible situation that a real physical world would present. To put it in simpler terms, what if God didn't actually create physical worlds and plants and trees and the like, but rather created a complex combination of concepts and ideas that mimic what a physical world would be like, and then subjected all of us to it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From that, I thought that maybe instead of every being created by God having a place in this reality, He created this particular reality for me only, and every aspect of this universe except my own thoughts and feelings and desires (and in some subsequent situations, my actions) were actually controlled by Him. In other words, what if everything around me does not actually exist, including all the people in the world, but instead I have been placed in this situation to learn show how I would act in this type of situation. I obviously could go on, but further development of this theory would take forever, and would inevitably bore whoever is reading this. And I haven't even got to the interesting part of this post yet.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">More back story:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While I was serving as a missionary in Ukraine, as I was approaching the end of my mission, I began assembling and committing to paper some of the things that I had learned thus far. One of these lessons, and something that I've written about here on this blog, is the idea that it's more important to focus on the why of actions, rather than on the action itself. In other words, instead of only focusing on doing good things, one should try to become a good person. I've also written about how the only way to become good at anything is to practice. I wrote about how, in order to become a good basketball player, one must practice basketball, and in order to become honest, one must simply be honest. While these theories, when juxtaposed in this way, seem to create a contradiction, or rather a circular argument, today I realized that I'm not the only person to have come up with this particular argument.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The vindication:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1641, Rene Descartes published his Meditations, which at least partially contain an argument very similar to the one that I came up with in high school. I did not hear it from him before I came up with it, rather we both came to that same conclusion. The same thing happened with Aristotle's view on virtue. Around 330 BC, Aristotle wrote the Nichomachean Ethics, which in its second book explains essentially the exact theory that I came up with on my mission. Again, I had never read Aristotle until this past week, and yet was able to formulate a theory almost identical to one of the most well-known and respected philosophers of all time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I say all of this not to brag that I have some great mind and that I should be revered, but rather to point out that these discoveries have given me a serious amount of confidence in my own ability not only to survive in the philosophical world, but to maybe even do really well. It helps me to see that I think in much of the same way as many of these great philosophers, and while I may not understand all of philosophy, I do have the mind and aptitude for it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now to work my bootay off so I can make good use of all of this. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Rule of Significant Figures as it Applies to Knowledge</title>
      <link>/blog/the-rule-of-significant-figures-as-it-applies-to-knowledge</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many philosophers debate about what kinds of knowledge we can be sure about, or what counts as knowledge. In fact, they created an entire philosophical discipline dedicated to trying to figure that out. I’m not going to try and delve too far into that field, but I do have a theory that relates.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The big problem of Epistemology, at least as I see it, is that there is no real way to prove that we can know anything. Skepticism attempts (and is largely successful, in my opinion) to reduce all attempts at showing knowledge to simple misperception by our frail and untrustworthy senses. Really, one can answer any assertion of knowledge with a simple denial of the dependability of the senses. After all, it is possible that each of us exists only in a metaphysical sense, not actually subsisting in the physical, tangible sense. It’s kind of a complicated thing to consider, but it’s unfortunately impossible to disprove.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the other hand, Skepticism has no way of completely denying knowledge, because it can’t really explain our thoughts. Descartes even talked about how everything reduces back to one's thoughts. So on the one hand, we can’t prove that we can know anything about the physical world, but we at least have to be able to know our own thoughts. What this boils down to is that although it’s impossible to show that most of our perception is unable to result in knowledge in us, there is something that results in knowledge in us. And I came up with a theory to explain it. (Sounds kind of quaint when I put it like that)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s actually pretty simple I think. Much like the rule of significant figures restricts the accuracy of a mathematical equation to its least precise component; the sureness of knowledge corresponds inversely with the number of physical media through which a proposition must travel before it reaches the mind. Simple, right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s see if I can break this down. A proposition (I’ll use the term to mean any idea or concept) makes its way to the mind through a variety of different media. For example, the proposition that there is a wall in front of me must travel through the medium of my eyes, optic nerve, and then has to be processed by my brain in order for me to comprehend it. However, what if the wall is just an optical illusion? Maybe it’s one of those hologram things, in which case I can’t really say I know that there’s a wall in front of me, because there isn’t. And every time I approach a wall like that, I have to consider the possibility that there isn’t actually a wall there, but rather the medium is messed up. By the same token, if I see a picture of something, or even better if I see something on TV, that adds a whole myriad of media through which the proposition, whatever it is that I’m seeing, must pass before it reaches my mind and I comprehend it. The theory becomes clearer as we examine the following example:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The game Telephone is a perfect example of how this works. The more people the phrase has to go through before the end, the more likely it is that the phrase will get messed up along the way somehow. So the closer you are to the original person that started the game, the more likely you are to get the original phrase. In the same way, the closer to the actual proposition the mind is, the more sure the knowledge is.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now for the fun part.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might seem like the closest that you can get to a proposition is to be standing right in front of it, but in fact the proposition can be much closer than that. In fact, the closest that you can get to a proposition is simply to think it. Of course, the thought has to come from the mind itself, not from any kind of outside stimulus. So if you see a wall, and then think, there’s a wall, it is still external knowledge. However, if you just think and come up with an original idea, about anything, that is the closest that you can get to the proposition, and is when knowledge is actually sure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, to sum up, only trust yourself<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>:)</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>What would Beethoven and Bach say about contemporary music?</title>
      <link>/blog/what-would-beethoven-and-bach-say-about-contemporary-music</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was thinking the other day about music, as I am very often doing, and I came to an interesting conclusion. Let’s see if I can recreate my thought process so this whole thing makes sense.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first thought that I had was part of what I always thought was an interesting paradox of my tastes. I have observed that the average person these days has a particular type of music that they particularly like, and that they listen to almost exclusively. It very often reflects their character, or at least seems to, and other types of music tend to clash with the person’s sensibilities, and so they find those other types of music to be of lesser quality than their particular favorite. All of this is well and good, and there is nothing wrong with having favorite music. The paradox is that I don’t have a favorite type of music. In the course of a month, if someone were to ask me what my favorite type of music was, I would either have 20 different answers, or I would list off all of the genres of music, just in a different order each time. I really do like all kinds of music, from classical (including baroque and romantic era and all that) to heavy metal, from country to smooth jazz, and from funk to ska. I even like Weird Al Yankovic and rap. I don’t think that I’m absolutely unique in that, but I most certainly do not represent the norm, I don’t think. I don’t like poorly written music, but that’s about all that I don’t like. That was my first thought.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My next thought took me on somewhat of a digression. I was thinking about the two men who contributed the most to contemporary logic, Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell. Bear with me here, I promise this will make sense. Frege spent much of his career creating first order logic, and after 20 years of slaving over it and doing more for logic than anyone else had done, Bertrand Russell discovered a critical problem with one of Frege’s initial premises. It’s known in the logic world as Russell’s Paradox. Here is the amazing part. When Russell wrote to Frege and pointed out the problem, Frege responded in a surprisingly classy way. Instead of blowing up and trying to discredit Russell, who was significantly younger than Frege, he immediately recognized his mistake and worked to correct it. He was willing to accept that his theories were not perfect, and almost welcomed the criticism.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then I got to thinking about logic in general. Aristotle and the Stoics way back in ancient Greece came up with syllogistic logic, and they used that all the way through the middle ages, up until Frege made his considerable advancements. Now, if Aristotle were to be brought to our time and see the advancements that have been made in logic, I think that he would be greatly impressed by them. I think that the complexity of the “new” types of logic would fascinate him and he would love to study it and learn how to use it. I can hardly imagine Aristotle scoffing at first order logic or set theory. Just because we are more advanced in logic today than he was at his time doesn’t mean that he would be disappointed that we didn’t stick with syllogistic logic. In fact, he would be thrilled to see the advancements, I think.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, back to music and the wrap up. I’d never considered the music question in terms of Aristotle and logic before, and so this thought brought new ideas to the table. I began to realize why I like so many different types of music. For centuries, because of slower communication and all that jazz, the advancements in music happened globally. That’s why we talk about the classical era, the baroque era, the romantic era, etc. Because they were complete eras of musical thought and complexity. However, starting in the 1900’s, with the advent of recording and advances in musical technology, that tendency to globally shift turned into musicians branching off and creating their own styles of music altogether. Now, the number of styles and genres is almost as big as the number of musicians. However, just as with the global shifts of previous centuries, each of these genres of music has undergone serious advancement with time, and the complexities of the music have intensified in many of the genres. Also, with the advent of different playing styles, there are genres of music that couldn’t have existed any time but now. I like so many types of music now because I see the musical value of each genre. I can trace every band or musician back to Beethoven and Bach, and seeing the progress is like watching a classic NBA game from the 60’s right before watching one from the 90’s (I think the NBA has gone downhill since the 90’s. Different story for a different time). Music these days has become much more intricate and complex, and I find it fascinating.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So what do I think Beethoven or Bach would say about contemporary music? I honestly think they would be as fascinated as Frege was, or as Aristotle would be, or as I am. There are so many more levels to music than they were capable of creating today. I think they would appreciate that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Two footnotes:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. There is plenty of crappy music out there today. Don’t think that I don’t recognize that. I think Beethoven and Bach would be the first to agree with me that music has both gotten better and gotten a whole lot worse.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. All of this points to another fact. The inability to see that progress in music of all genres these days is the result of one very simple thing: arrogant ignorance</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A Call to Reflection</title>
      <link>/blog/a-call-to-reflection</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the last few months, I've had a certain thought on my mind, and just recently it has developed into an opinion. Those of you who are unfortunate enough to know me are aware of the catastrophe that follows any instance of a thought becoming an opinion in my mind. Usually, I repeat my opinion ad nauseam to anyone that is bored enough or confined enough to sit through it. I think maybe this is my way of solidifying the opinion within myself, not unlike practice of a musical instrument solidifies the technique and notes in the musician. In any case, I have tried (somewhat unsuccessfully) to keep it to myself until I could formulate it into a post here, so you can simply read it and be done with it. For those to whom I've already begun the unceasing flapping of my jaws on this topic, I apologize for past grievances and assure you that this might be the last time you have to hear it. The only thing I ask is that you not stop halfway through. I am aware that some of what I say will be slightly offensive in some way or another to everyone that reads this. If you don't feel like getting a little pricked, don't even bother to read at all. But if you start into this, please try to read all the way to the end.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That being said:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The past three years have been very informative for me. Obviously I've spent quite a bit of time in the classroom during that time, and so I've been informed in that respect. That will not be the topic of discussion here. I want to talk about the other ways in which these past three years have been informative. Specifically, I want to talk about Mormons.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mormons are an interesting subset of the population. I don't know that there is another demographic that is quite as paradoxical, statistically speaking. For example, Mormons are generally known as "the nice family down the street," or "very clean." Many references are made to our abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, and more especially from coffee and tea. Many comment on our strict abstinence from sexual relations outside of marriage, and our doctrinal abhorrence of pornography and masturbation. These last two are particularly strange to many people, but we are respected for them nonetheless. We are portrayed as having some strange rules, but overall being a very agreeable, sensible, and kind people. At the same time, Mormons are statistically famous for having the highest percentage of dependency on anti-depressant drugs. A much less well known statistic shows that of men who admit to having indulged in pornographic materials, most are from Utah. Utah leads the porn-subscription percentages (number of pornographic subscriptions per 1000 households, here's the study http://people.hbs.edu/bedelman/papers/redlightstates.pdf). Of course, not everyone in Utah is Mormon, but over half of them are, meaning the number of coincidences between the two groups (i.e. porn subscribers and Mormons) is inevitably quite substantial. And let's not forget BYU students. Regardless of what you may have heard, a large majority of current BYU students are inconsiderate, immoral, dishonest, and flat out mean. I realize that in comparison with any other university, BYU can boast that it is home to the best of the best, but here in Provo, it's a different story. (Disclaimer: I'm not accusing all BYU students equally, so if you read this and are offended that I would make such allegations, I'm probably not talking about you)This brings me to point #1. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over Christmas break, I went to a party with some friends from high school. All of them drank at the party. It wasn't a loud, boisterous drinking party, but I was the only one not drinking some sort of alcoholic beverage, and I felt totally comfortable and accepted by them. There was no pretense, there was no unnecessary joking, just friends getting together to spend time together. Did I mention that some of them have expressed (not to me, of course) a severe dislike of Mormons? In spite of what must have been serious religious differences, they were able to have a pleasant evening with us, and I daresay that despite my still being Mormon, I made some friends that night. I haven't really felt that way in relation to any of my fellow Brigham-ites since then, with a few exceptions. In other words, I, a staunch Mormon, felt more comfortable around non-Mormons who dislike Mormons and who were drinking than I ever do around BYU students (*Mormon BYU students). It's not even so much a matter of feeling comfortable as it is feeling accepted. I felt completely accepted by them, whereas I find myself purposefully excluded from many circles here at BYU. I see a problem.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Point #2</b>. To address the statistical paradox mentioned earlier, it's important to look at it objectively. This is not a call to repentance, so I'm not breathing hell-fire and damnation. What I'm trying to do is open the reader's eyes a little and hopefully instill a desire for serious personal reflection and self-examination. Mormons abuse anti-depressants. Why? There are all kinds of possible explanations, the most popular being a need to "keep up with the Jones'." My boss mentioned another which I consider equally valid. He said, "Mormons self medicate with anti-depressants because they aren't self medicating with drugs and alcohol like the rest of the world." Or what about the pornography question? I think the reason is that Mormons have been deceived by popular media into thinking that sexual gratification is the sole purpose of life. I agree with all of these ideas, but I think the real root of the problem is a little deeper, and more over-arching. Mormons feel the need to "keep up with the Jones'" and are particularly susceptible to pornography because Mormon society has placed greater value on the appearance of belief than on belief itself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Point #3.</b> Let's look at a few instances of Mormon culture and see if what I'm saying holds. We'll start with Fast and Testimony meeting. We all know the stereotypical Fast and Testimony meeting script. If you've seen The Singles' Ward, then you know exactly what I'm talking about. I've been a member of the church for close to 25 years, and I've almost never missed a Fast and Testimony meeting in that time, that I can remember. The thing that I've learned about them is that there are certain things that you say when giving your testimony. For example, "I know the church is true," or, "Joseph Smith is a true prophet," or, "President ... is a true prophet," or, "I am so grateful for this opportunity to share my testimony," etc. We have this system of stock phrases, and deviation from those stock phrases is considered improper on some level. There are a lot of things about which I could talk in this regard, but I'll focus on one particular example and on one broad principle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The particular example is using the phrase "I know." We are constantly berated with people telling us that they know the church is true, or they know that the Book of Mormon is true. What this has done is foster an environment in which it is not OK to not know those things. If everyone else knows, and I don't know, then I am somehow on a lower spiritual level than they are. In other words, if I don't know, then I'm sinning in some way. But I don't feel like I'm sinning by not knowing, so rather than give the impression to everyone else that I am sinning, I'll just say that I know to avoid the awkwardness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The broad principle, which also somewhat applies here, is that we tend to use stock phrases as space-fillers in talks, prayers, Sunday School lessons, for fear of not having something to say, or for fear of saying the wrong thing. For example, in prayers, we almost invariably open our prayers with some combination of the following words, "Our dear, kind, gracious Father in Heaven/Heavenly Father," immediately after which we thank God for "this day," and at some point in the prayer we ask God to bless our food to "nourish and strengthen our bodies." The most ironic part about that last phrase is that it does not matter what food we are eating, we always ask that it will nourish and strengthen our bodies. We bless salads, sandwiches, pancakes, burgers, steak, ice cream, onion rings, KFC, twinkies, and on certain occasions (firesides) cookies, donuts, and soda, to "nourish and strengthen our bodies." Now, I'm not going to try to make an exhaustive list of these filler phrases, but I think you get my drift here. There are certain words and phrases that we use simply because that's what culture dictates.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Point #4.</b> Both of these examples, which do not by any means constitute and exhaustive list, show very clearly the importance that Mormon culture has placed on the appearance of righteousness (goodness, strength, etc.). I want to talk about another, more serious one. This, I think, is the absolute epitome of the problem. I've noticed, not only in myself, but also through anecdotal evidence, that Mormons are afraid to admit that they make mistakes. I'm not talking about little unimportant mistakes, but bigger, almost membership-jeopardizing mistakes. We are very quick to point out that, in general, we all make mistakes. We are all, in theory, humble, but in actuality, how many of us put on a mask to hide the very serious problems with which we are struggling? How many young men in the church wait until they are caught to discuss sexual addictions with parents or priesthood leaders? How often do grown men, fathers and husbands, do the same? Missionaries, out of fear of being sent home, hide things from their mission presidents. When missionaries do get sent home, they are talked about in hushed whispers in the back of the chapel, "I wonder what he did." We, as members of the church, are so attached to the image of righteousness that we feel we are expected to wear that we use it to cover up the problems that eat at us from the inside. And so we struggle on, hoping beyond reason that somehow we will be strong enough to overcome sin by ourselves. And then we raise our hand in Sunday School and talk of the doctrine of the Atonement, cleverly and beautifully describing how no person can overcome sin alone. Do you see the problem here?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Point #5</b>. I think it's obvious where I'm going with this. Let's take each of the three examples and dissect it a little.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">"I know." I would venture to say that, among the membership of the church (13 mill) about 200 people actually "know" anything in this way. How does one come to a real knowledge of spiritual things? It is not by spiritual revelation alone, but by physical manifestation accompanied by spiritual revelation. Joseph Smith knew that God existed, because he saw Him. I would venture to say that the general authorities of the church know of these things because they are given some sort of physical manifestation along with their calling. Maybe they don't see God as Joseph did, but I believe there is more than just the whispering of the Spirit, and I don't just mean signs or coincidences. I'm talking about irrefutable physical evidence which touches them specifically and proves to them that these things are true. They are called to be special witnesses of Christ, meaning those who can say that they know, not because they felt it, but because they have experienced it. I also think that there are an elect few of the "lay members" of the church who have experienced this sort of physical manifestation, but that number cannot be greater than 20 or 30, as I see it. So why do we say that we "know" of these things? Simple. Because that's what you say. We hear in General Conference and from Alma that we are supposed to know certain things. The Bible says that to some is given to know, and others to believe on their words. We take all this to mean that believing is somehow less important than knowing, and we all want to be the ones that know. Somehow we are less spiritual if we just believe, as opposed to knowing. Our interpretation of Alma 34 has convinced us that we should be at the stage where our faith has become dormant, because we have knowledge. How pretentious of us. How incredibly irrational of us. How perfect do we think we are? Those to whom it is given to know are those who are called to be special witnesses. That is a very small number of people, comprising the First Presidency, Council of the Twelve, Quorums of the Seventy, The General Presidencies of the Relief Society, Young Men, Young Women, and Primary, and the Presiding Bishopric. To the rest of us is given to believe on their words. That is why they are called. Alma is talking about faith in his entire discourse, and merely mentions the fact that once we know, our faith becomes dormant. He's trying to get us to understand that we need to have faith, not knowledge, until we are called upon to have that knowledge. The point here is this: You'll know when you know. It will be obvious. There will be no question left in your mind. It will be a big deal. If you're reading this, chances are you haven't had that experience (unless somehow someone in Salt Lake hears about this and takes a gander, scary thought), and therefore you don't know. The beautiful thing, as I'll point out soon, is that you don't have to know. It's perfectly OK not to know.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Filler words and stock phrases. I only pointed out a handful of these stock phrases, but we all know that there are absolutely hundreds of these types of stock phrases. We use them because we feel obligated to a sense of consistency or because we don't want to sound abnormal, which in a community of "perfectly righteous" Mormons can only mean that you are an outsider, or not perfectly righteous. Here's the problem. A solid third of what we say in Mormon settings (church, seminary, religion classes, etc.) is nothing more than hot air. We don't believe or mean what we're saying, because we're just using stock phrases. Christ called them "vain repetitions." I think too often we overlook the principles that the scriptures are so blatantly trying to teach us. We are very focused on gaining the deep knowledge, and so we miss the obvious things. This is a perfect example. (Now, I'll warn the reader, the next few lines of this post will probably offend you, so steel yourself.) I think what Christ had in mind when He said "vain repetitions" is most adequately summed up in the contemporary wording of that idea: bullshit. I don't think it necessary to go into the particulars of what constitutes bullshit; for that I highly recommend that the you read the definitive work on the subject by Harry Frankfurt, entitled "On Bullshit." I do want to talk a little more about the particular application here, however. I think that these stock phrases that we use, because of the lack of real emotional connection that we have to them, are all just plain bullshit (I'll abbreviate it to b.s. from now on). I think that if you read Frankfurt's article, you will most readily agree with me on this point. B.S. is simply the act of presenting oneself as being in a certain state of mind (i.e. believing something, meaning what one says, having a connection to one's words, etc.) when in fact one is not in that state of mind. So here, it is b.s. to use words simply because they are stock phrases, or to use filler words to avoid silence, or even worse, to fill our prayers with these stock phrases or filler words. The words we use should be directly connected with our emotions and our desires, and if we say anything, ever, that is not directly connected to some personal feeling or belief or desire, we are b.s.-ing. In other words, any time we say something that we don't actually mean to say (that's what I mean by emotional connection), what we have said is b.s. I've already shown that we do this all the time, so where does that leave us? Here's where: Mormons are full of b.s.! (Don't worry, the world will be happy again soon)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Hiding our mistakes. I see this most prevalently in myself. Of course, being that close to the problem makes me a bit of an expert on it, and so I recognize the signs that someone is hiding something. Let me tell you about that for a little. The most obvious sign that someone is hiding something, whether it be a mistake or just problems in general, is that they seem to have everything going for them. Their life seems quite perfect in every way. They are always happy, always laughing and smiling, and are generally very fun to be around. Reality check: Nobody's life is that perfect. Granted, there are those who can be happy even when their circumstances are terrible, but the difference is that these people don't try to hide the problems. They don't flaunt them, but usually when you know someone that is happy in spite of circumstances, you know about the circumstances. Otherwise you'd have no way of knowing that they are happy in spite of something. Now, this mask of happiness that people use to hide their problems creates an ironic and paradoxical problem, especially in Mormon culture. As with the other examples we've seen, Mormons equate any departure from the norm as an indication of an outsider, and an outsider of a seriously religious and righteous group is by definition a sinner. I realize how ridiculous that logic sounds on paper, but I promise, that is exactly how it works. So what we get is a large group of people who all see how perfect everyone else's life is, and think that if their lives aren't as perfect as everyone else's, then they must be doing something wrong. In an effort to not come across as sinning, they, and in turn, we all, simply sweep our problems under the rug, hoping that if nobody else sees them, the problems will vanish. The problem here is obvious; everyone seems to have the perfect life, and nobody actually does. Nobody's life is nearly as perfect as they let on. The real problem comes when this is applied to serious transgressions that need to be confessed to proper authority. These go unresolved because we want to avoid the appearance of having made a mistake. We are so afraid of the social consequences of our actions becoming known that we completely disregard the eternal consequences of not resolving the problems. Here's the one-liner that I think sums up this whole bullet point quite nicely: You don't have to be happy all the time to be happy.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Pre-conclusion #1</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What is the point of all this? Simple. Mormon culture has placed too great an emphasis on the appearance of believing, and all but left out actual belief. The result is that the large majority of Mormons act like they believe without any shadow of a doubt in the doctrine of the Church without having any real belief. In other words, we say (by our words, actions, demeanor) that we "know the Church is true" when in reality we don't have a clue whether it's true or not, or whether we really even care. If you feel like I'm challenging your faith or trying to shake your belief in Christ or the Church, good. That is exactly the point of this whole post. I am very actively attacking your beliefs and faith. I'm digging right into your heart, opening it up and showing it to the world so everyone will know that belief is not to be found there. Why am I doing this? Because if every Mormon really believed in what we are taught, the problems that I've brought up here would not exist. It's as simple as that. Even if the majority of Mormons really believed, those problems would go away. And yet there they are, sitting in front of you. Therefore, not even a majority of Mormons can possibly have any kind of real belief, and because of this, the chances are just better than 50% that you are one of those that doesn't actually believe, but instead just affirms belief. So yes, I am challenging you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Pre-conclusion #2</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why am I so viciously attacking you like this? Again, simple. I want you to see your reaction. There are basically three ways that you can react to this.</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">You can either get extremely offended, defensive, and even angry that I would dare to challenge your faith.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">You can simply shrug your shoulders and not care.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">You can look yourself in the mirror and honestly ask yourself, "Do I believe?"</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I suspect that your initial reaction was the first. I hope it wasn't the second. I forgive you for having either of those initial reactions. I sincerely hope that regardless of your initial reaction, you will do number 3 once you finish reading this. Here is why:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Conclusion</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the end of the day (i.e. when we stand before God to be judged), it won't matter how righteous or faithful we appeared to be. God doesn't really care what the Jones's thought about how strong of a testimony we had. He is concerned with you. He wants to see whether or not you actually do believe, and whether you are willing to act on that belief. What other people think has absolutely no significance whatsoever. Your testimony, your righteousness, your worth, are all between God and you. Just you. So do yourself and me a favor. Forget about what everyone else does. Forget what other people think about you. Forget about needing to "know." Forget about needing to look righteous. Whoever you are, wherever you live, go find the nearest mirror, look yourself in the eyes, and ask yourself, "What do I really believe?" And don't move a muscle until you've realized/decided what it is that you, in isolation from every other human being on the planet, actually believe. It doesn't matter what it is that you believe as much as it matters that you know that the belief is 100% yours. If you do this, I promise it will be the most spiritually cathartic experience that you've ever had. The most important part, however, is that when you talk about it (in testimony meeting), only say those words which come from inside you. Don't say you know if you don't know. Don't say you believe in things in which you don't believe. Just say the words that come from your heart. Your heart. Express you.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A long overdue apology</title>
      <link>/blog/a-long-overdue-apology</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I want to take a break from my grandstanding and say something that I should have said a long time ago. Really, I should have realized that this needed to be said a long time ago, but I'm stubborn and proud. I'm working on that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My therapist says I'm an angry person. I think he's right. Everything that I do and everything that happens to me is tinted by an underlying layer of anger that I've never fully understood (or tried to understand, for that matter). Tonight, I think I may have made a breakthrough discovery, and please don't take this as a pity party. There's a point here.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I've spent the last couple of years dealing with a deep feeling of isolation. I feel isolated from people, disconnected from relationships. I haven't really felt important to anyone in a very long time. I find myself angrily "advertising" my blog posts on Facebook, absolutely pissed that people don't care enough about me to read on their own. I sometimes just sit and fume that I don't have people in my life that want to know how I feel, and how I'm really doing, at least not people who are proactive about letting me know that they care. I don't want this to turn into a sob story, but the point is that I've just felt like a means to an end, instead of an end unto itself. I feel like everyone should be treated like ends unto themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tonight, I made a startling discovery. That phrase, what goes around comes around, is absolutely true.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I started thinking tonight about why I feel the way I do. What is it about me that people want to stay away from, or that keeps people at arm’s length from me? Why am I fighting so hard with people to get them to notice me and appreciate me? Then it hit me.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was an absolute jerk in high school, and even on my mission. Even after coming back from my mission I haven't really improved that much, although I do like to think that I've improved some. But back then, nothing mattered but what I thought. I was the ultimate example of good and correct, and everyone else just didn't measure up. I'm surprised that people would still talk to me after putting up with that for so long. Here's the kicker. I treated everyone as an means to and end, except for one person. I won't go into who or why; the point is I was a jerk to almost everyone. And here I am feeling sorry for myself because I'm so isolated from everyone. What do I expect after treating people so terribly?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I hope that everyone I've ever known reads this next part, because I feel like I've taken advantage of just about everyone that I know.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I'm so sorry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I'm sorry for everything. The holier-than-thou attitude that I had, the pride in my own infallibility, the using people for my own purposes, I'm sorry for all of it. I'm sorry for making you feel like dirt with things that I said. I'm sorry for disregarding your feelings on my "quest for spiritual perfection". I'm sorry for "never being wrong". I could go on forever. I'm sorry to each and every one of you for everything that I've done to you. I've been a terrible friend to most of you, and worse to some of you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I love you all for the fact that you didn't just leave me alone in high school, or ever for that matter. I am so grateful that you have enough patience with me to give me so many second chances. I can't tell you how terrible I feel each time I remember another instance when I took advantage of you or betrayed you. I'm doing my penance now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I just want you all to know that I'm sorry for whatever I may have done to you in the past, and that I'm now reaping the rewards of my actions. I honestly regret the way that I acted back then, and I'm working hard to not continue in that way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And I'll always be sorry.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Sunday Evening Thoughts</title>
      <link>/blog/sunday-evening-thoughts</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week has been one of reflection, as you can probably tell from my posts. Now, at the end of the week, I am thinking back on the week and I'm having even more thoughts (go figure). Here they are:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I've decided that, at the end of the day, life is about relationships. The only things that seem to really matter to people are their relationships with other people. We always hear stories about the rich people that don't find solace in their money because they end up all alone with it, or the Hollywood stars who do crazy things because they don't have real friends to turn to. Those stories never really sunk in for me.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But recently, as you may know if you've read the more recent posts on this blog, I've had a similar sort of experience myself. I thought that I was alone, without real friends who care about me as a person and who consider me important to them. I felt like I had a lot of people that I consider friends and who are very important to me, but not many who felt that way about me. Suddenly, the whole being alone thing was very personal. I was understanding, for myself, what it feels like to really feel alone and isolated from people. It wasn't a fun feeling.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then Thursday happened, and I started thinking a little differently. I started to realize that I have a lot of people who may not be in my life every day, but who still have my back when it comes down to it. People who I didn't realize still remembered who I was, or people who I thought were just happy to be rid of me, sending me notes of encouragement and support. I realized that you don't have to see or hear from these kinds of people for them to support you. These are the people that, regardless of the incredibly stupid things you do or the way you act, somehow see something worth knowing and befriending in you, and don't run off when the going gets tough or you really need a hand with something. Then I came to the following thought:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Life is about the relationships you build and maintain. It's not about the money you make, or the songs you write, or the pictures you paint, or the diseases you cure, or any of that. It's all about the people that have your back. It's all about having those people's back. It's all about those real, deep relationships that go beyond just the initial utility of having a certain person as a friend. It's about making connections with someone else, and creating that bond.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I've come to realize that, to me, the most important thing in life are those relationships. Having felt as though I'd lost them, I appreciate them so much more now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Moral of the story:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take a look at your relationships. Are you putting enough effort into the important relationships in your life? Are you making an effort to be on good terms with your family, and keep in touch with them? Are you really trying to help your close friends realize how important they are to you? Are you sincerely making an effort to show your spouse (if you have one) how important they are to you? If you're not, you should stop to think about how important those relationships are to you, and you'll realize that you need to put in that effort before you're left with nothing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I know I haven't done well at this at all, which I think is why I was so down on myself this week. Save yourself the grief of having to go through that, and make those real connections.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You'll be surprised at how much happier you'll be if you do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You'll regret it if you don't.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Monday Evening Thoughts (written on Tuesday morning)</title>
      <link>/blog/monday-evening-thoughts-written-on-tuesday-morning</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think sometimes you just need to be ok with things not working out before you can really appreciate when they do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People are always telling me that I should plan for the worst, that way when things do work out it will be that much more exciting. I always thought that was a little too pessimistic and depressing for me, so I never did it. I've always sort of expected the best things to happen, and when they don't, I usually just push back until they at least kind of work out the way I wanted. I guess I've always just wanted things to go they way I want (oh the ironic redundancy of that statement), and I've never been ok with anything else.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think I'm finally starting to figure it out, however.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This internship has been on my mind for a couple of months now. When I went to that meeting (again, mostly for the donuts), I didn't think I would be as excited about it or want to do it as badly as I discovered that I do. However, I'm not in a position to put down $20,000 (which is what it would have realistically cost) for that kind of experience. I simply can't afford it. I spent a while coming to grips with the fact that the Moscow gig wasn't going to happen for me, and I should let it go. Once I finally let it go, it wasn't three days but I get a call saying I could go for free (essentially).That was super exciting. I was so sure that it was a slam dunk deal and I'd definitely get to go. However, there were questions. I had to figure out whether I would still be able to graduate in December and whether or not I would be able to complete the one remaining religion credit that I would need to graduate at all. I had to make sure that the university would let me change my second major to a minor, and I had to figure out, if I could take an independent study course for the religion requirement, how I would handle the proctored exams, because I would be a long way from any authorized university testing centers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of these questions were depressing. First, the university has a policy that you have to go through a petition process to change your major after you have 90 credits (I have 95). Second, the deadline for counting an independent study course for Spring/Summer is in the middle of July, and we wouldn't get back from Moscow until the middle of August. Third, what happens if I can't get my job back when I return? These were all serious roadblocks, and I was a little upset that so many roadblocks would immediately present themselves. To me, it seemed like revelation, and there shouldn't be any difficulty. And yet, there they were, not going anywhere. Annoying little buggers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I spent a few hours fuming over all of these questions, and especially over the fact that it was a three-day weekend, and I wouldn't be able to get most of those questions answered until Tuesday morning (this morning). So I just had to sit and stew all weekend, trying to enjoy the break, but not really being able to because I had this looming over my head. Then something clicked inside me.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I remembered how I felt when Dr. Brown called and offered me the position. I remember how good it felt to find out that someone else was thinking of me like that, and that I was important to someone, and not just any someone either. These are tenured professors at a university who were thinking of me. It meant the world to me. Once I realized that it was possible that the only reason that I had been offered the position was so that I would feel important to someone, I instantly calmed down and was ok with all of the questions. Hence the follow-up post (The very next day).I spent the rest of the weekend very relaxed and happy. I was actually ok with not going, because I knew that even if I couldn't go, I had still received something priceless from just being offered the position. It was nice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Moral of the story:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes you need to be ok with the worst possible outcome. It's ok to just cut your losses and appreciate what you've already got. You definitely appreciate when things go right if you're already expecting them to go wrong. Plus, if you don't expect things to go right, then you spend more time trying to make them go right, and you find other things that would have gone wrong otherwise. So be pessimistic, but be positive in your pessimism. Plan for the worst, expect the worst, and work accordingly. The important thing is to be ok with whatever happens, and not get too worked up over things. Life is going to throw you curveballs, and you may not always hit them, but at least you're on a team, right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">PS Most of those issues worked themselves out in a matter of 30 minutes this morning. The university's policy on major changes after 90 credits only applies to your primary major, and the religion department allows you to take 5 credits if you're taking Survey of World Religions (the only 3-credit religion class) and another class (in my case, D&amp;C). My boss is more than willing to take me back after the summer, and I even got a lead on a job for after I graduate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes you just have to be ok with things not working out. Then when they do work out, it's like Christmas morning :) </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Logic vs Intuition: the fatal confusion</title>
      <link>/blog/logic-vs-intuition-the-fatal-confusion</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b29d50bc07b083624e43b07/1529468457009/pexels-photo-310386-e1498099319292.jpeg" alt=""/>
  

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I've become more and more aware recently of how often people claim to appeal to logic, when in fact they are appealing to intuition. The sad part is that most of the time, people don't even realize what they're doing. It turns out that about 99% of the time, people unwittingly disguise their own intuition as logic, and by so doing ascribe certain attributes and characteristics to logic that simply do not exist.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What people don't understand (I didn't even understand this until recently) is that there is a big difference between that which is intuitive and that which is logical. Logic is characterized by a rigorous application of certain axioms (e.g. modus ponens, modus tollens, reductio ad absurdum, and so on), constructed in such a way so as to show the truth of certain proposals. In other words, logic involves proofs. Intuition, on the other hand, does not. In fact, intuition consists of those concepts or ideas which make rational sense in a person's mind without any appeal to proof. It would seem, then, that logic only comes after the proof has been constructed, and only intuition can come before that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What I'm trying to say is that you can't just make an appeal to logic without actually considering real logical implications. And most importantly, you can't assume that just because something doesn't make sense to you that it's not logical. In fact, most of the time, real logic is far from intuitive. The reason why we want to equate our intuition with logic is because we understand on some level that logic is objective and intuition is subjective; we could be wrong!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One individual who is particularly guilty of equating logic with intuition is none other than Dr. Gregory House, M.D.. He appeals to logic at least once every episode, and yet there is absolutely no logic involved in any of his arguments. In fact, the closest he ever gets to real logic is when he says, "It's not logical." The closest that he ever gets to constructing a proof is when he says, "That doesn't make any sense." Well yeah moron, it doesn't make sense to you, but that doesn't make it illogical. The aggregate sum of your experiences which has led you to believe so totally in your own infallibility does not actually constitute objective logic. Just because you thought it doesn't make it right, or rather, just because you call it logic doesn't make it logic!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He also makes the absolutely fatal mistake of using the term "rational" in certain instances when he means to use "logical" but should use the following sentence: "I like/dislike that idea." At least that way he'd be speaking honestly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another example, which I encountered last week, is the scene from The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe (the new version), in which Susan and Peter are talking with the professor about Lucy's newfound obsession with Narnia. I love how the professor responds. I found a transcription of the scene:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Susan: It's our sister sir, Lucy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prof: The weeping girl?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Susan: Yes sir, she's upset.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prof: Hence the weeping</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Peter: We can handle it! (takes Susan's sleeve)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prof: Oh, I can see that.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Susan: She thinks she's found a magical land in the upstairs wardrobe.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prof: What did you say!?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Peter: The wardrobe upstairs, Lucy thinks she's found a forest inside.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prof: What was it like?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Susan: Like talking to a lunatic!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prof: No, not her - the forest!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Peter: You....you actually believe her?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prof: Well don't you?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Susan: Well, logically it couldn't possibly be there!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prof: What do they teach at these schools?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Peter: Edmund said they were only pretending</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prof: And he's the more truthful one is he?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Peter: No, this would be the first time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Prof: Well then, if your sister isn't lying and isn't mad then logically we must assume that she is telling the truth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This scene shows the perfect juxtaposition of logic and intuition. Susan, as is the case with most people, is so caught up in her own intuition that she fails to see that the only logical option here is that Lucy is telling the truth. The professor points that out very clearly, and incidentally, the professor presents a compelling proof to that effect. Here is the proof:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Lucy says that she and Edmund went to Narnia.
2. Edmund says that they didn't go to Narnia.
3. Either Lucy or Edmund is lying.
4. It's more likely that Edmund is lying.
5. Lucy isn't crazy.
6. Lucy isn't lying and Lucy isn't crazy.
C. Lucy and Edmund did go to Narnia.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That's logic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like I said before, logic is rarely intuitive, but because we associate logic with objective truth, and because we all invariably want to believe in our own infallibility, we tend to equate our own intuition with that objective truth in order to avoid the painful process of realizing that there is a possibility that our intuition is simply wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problems arise when two people disagree based on intuition but they both try to convince the other of the illogicality of their claims. In other words, when two people try to assert that the way someone else thinks is illogical. You simply can't do that. Logic has nothing to do with how someone thinks, because it is completely objective. It doesn't matter how you think or how you were raised, logic is the same for everyone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I could go on, but I won't. I'll just end with this:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don't claim that something is illogical if you can't back it up with a logical proof. Don't claim that someone's logic is flawed without showing, formally, the actual flaw in the structure of the argument. Don't try to accuse someone of being illogical just because it's a convenient way to falsely strengthen your argument. If you disagree with someone, just say, "I disagree with you about X because Y," and call it a night. Just don't talk about logic like you know anything about it unless you actually do. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After my long quasi-rant that I went on in my <a href="http://bretwardjames.com/logic-vs-intuition-the-fatal-confusion/">previous post</a>, I began to think about logic (naturally) and that led me to think of the professor who has taught and is still teaching me logic. He's easily one of my favorite teachers ever, and yesterday he mentioned that when he is particularly frustrated or upset at something (or more often, someone) he writes limericks. He said that this really helps him to get out his frustration in a somewhat diffusing manner. Inspired by this, I condensed my previous post about logic and intuition into a limerick. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it:</span></p>

      <title>The Irony of Human Communication</title>
      <link>/blog/the-irony-of-human-communication</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b29d50bc07b083624e43b01/1529468459865/pexels-photo-24897-e1498098800752.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You know, for supposedly being the only species capable of advanced communication, humans are really bad at communicating.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This isn't going to be a rant or a rave about how some particular person angered me with their inability to communicate effectively. This is simply the expression of an idea that occurred to me today. It's sort of the final piece to a puzzle where it's impossible to really tell what the puzzle is until you have all of the pieces. Needless to say, this little idea was particularly revelatory.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I've struggled for a long time with a particular idea. I've wondered how it is that everyone else in the world seems to automatically understand everything that is said by everyone else, where I tend to be very confused at times. I've also wondered those same people that understand everything else that's said by every other person never really seem to understand what I am trying to say to them. At first I just thought that I wasn't being clear, so I spent a very long period of time working on saying exactly what I meant to say, and being perfectly honest. This didn't solve the problem, unfortunately. In fact, I sometimes think it made it worse. So why is it that I, or any other person, could be so deeply misunderstood so often? One word.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Language.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I've written before about the power of human language and its deep influence on everything that we encounter. I don't want to diminish that image in any way, simply point out that there are a few fatal flaws inherent in language, which we often overlook. I don't exactly know what my conclusion is going to be from this, but we'll get to that soon enough:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first flaw with language is that it is independent of the individual. Language is created by a society which mutually agrees on certain sounds, gestures, and symbols which will represent certain objects, people, places, or ideas. It is a way for many people to understand and be understood in a mutually beneficial way. There's also the benefit of having a particular "code" which is known only to those in the "in-group" which allows for free communication without the risk of everyone picking up on what you're saying. The problem with it, however, is that it is an objective body of concepts which a person has to access in order to be understood or understand. In other words, in order for a person to be understood, he or she must express the ideas or emotions in terms of something that is actually foreign to the person's mind. I have always considered it interesting when people ask me if I think in English or in Russian. Obviously I do have thoughts which are formulated into word form, which are usually in English, but I have a decent percentage of those word-thoughts in Russian as well. However, those word-thoughts only make up about 3% of the stuff that goes on inside me. I don't usually think in words. I usually think in...things that aren't words. I suspect that is true for most people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The second flaw with language is how much is inherently "lost in translation." Because we have to access that objective, foreign bank of words in order to express ourselves, we really are translating our thoughts and emotions into words. Ever wondered why not every concept translated directly from language to language? Classic example: The word вообще in Russian usually translates as "in general" in English, except that isn't really what the Russians are trying to say. I honestly believe that there is no real English equivalent in English, although I'm sure others would disagree. The point is that in some contexts it simply doesn't mean "in general". I think that is a perfect indication that different societies and different cultures came up with a designated word for a designated thought or concept or emotion based on the need to use it. The real problem now is that if I ever want to express the concept embodied in вообще in English, I have to spend 5 minutes explaining what I'm trying to express, which is not what I want to do. I understand the concept perfectly, and every other Russian-speaking American that I know understands it perfectly, and yet we all have the same problem expressing it. It's because we are limited by our language. The third flaw with language is that understanding requires true empathy. In order to really understand what someone is trying to say, you have to understand everything about their background and experiences. In other words, the words (W) that one uses to express an emotion can also be used by another person to express an entirely different emotion. So if W can be used to express two completely different concepts, the only way for the first person to understand the second is for her to understand why W came to mean what the second person intends.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So what was the idea that came to me? I suddenly realized that my inability to accurately communicate wasn't my fault at all. The problem lies with the medium. It's like trying to make a Skype call on a really slow computer. Half of what you say is stuck in frozen internet video chat land. The emotions that I have inside are almost too complex for me to understand before trying to translate them into a faulty medium and hope that someone else will figure it out on the other end. I had tried to spent precious moments painting incredibly intricate word paintings with ornate language in an attempt to capture every nuance of the emotion or idea, and I was doing it based on my own understanding of what words mean and how they are to be used. Unfortunately, not only was I boring my audience with my laborious wordplay, I was expecting the transmission of ideas to be decrypted without flaw on the other end. It was almost never flawless.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Emotion cannot really be expressed in words. At least not usually. There are certain geniuses of prose that have somehow managed to capture certain emotions with words, but I would consider only a very select few from the history of the world that actually had that ability. And even these masters would admit that they are incredibly limited in the emotions that they are capable of encapsulating on paper, for even the most skilled of poets cannot express emotion that has never been experienced.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think I'm coming to my conclusion. Hopefully you can follow the stream of thought that led to this point. I'm going to take a fairly large leap, and I hope you see the connection, but I'll understand if you don't.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For centuries, certain emotions and ideas have been domesticated (by domesticated I mean tamed and fit into a box with a universal definition; so the emotion somehow means the same thing for everyone) to the point that we consider them to be universally similar. For example, how many poets or authors or artists have tried to tell us what love is? Practically every poet worth his salt has written a love ballad, and every author has written a love story. It seems to be one of those unifying emotions that humans have in common. However, how many of these poems or songs or paintings really capture the way you feel about the people you love? Ever noticed how they all come so close, but they don't quite get it perfectly right? I know I do. Why is that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Love is not a universally domesticated emotion. My feeling of love is unique to me. Nobody else feels exactly the same about their significant other as I do about mine. No other person, saying they love another person, is experiencing the exact same thing as I am when I say it. And yet we have one word for it. The ironic thing is that sometimes we try to judge whether someone else is really in love. We try to advise them by saying things like, "When you're in love..." Are you starting to see the irony in a statement like that? Love is a personal, subjective emotion.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another great example of this is pain. What is pain? Does anyone really know what pain is? And why is it that, although we have one word for it, there isn't really a universal standard for pain? Why do some people experience serious pain in the presence of light or sound (migraines) and some don't? Or why do some people fall into deep depression after ending a serious relationship, and others seem to be just fine? Same reason as before. Pain is not a universally domesticated emotion. It's the same as with love. It's literally impossible to accurately define pain using words, because pain, like love, is subjective.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So love songs aren't really describing love, but rather the artist.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I feel like I'm treading trodden trails here.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think what I'm trying to say is that we should all take a second to take stock of how we relate to our native tongues. Most of us don't have the artistic chops to really express just what we are feeling, let alone what someone else is feeling, and yet somehow we tend to attribute certain emotions (and their accompanying explanations) to other people. We try to explain to ourselves why a person feels the way that they do, in hopes that it will make us feel better about our own inaction. We walk around, very full of ourselves and our supposed command of our own language, when really, we are no more in command of our native language than we are in command of the seasons. If anything, our language commands us. It directs the way we think and molds us into a certain type of person.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That's why I prefer instrumental music and the visual arts to written art. I doubt it's easy, but it seems that more composers, painters, and photographers have been able to convey pure emotion in a real way than have writers. The words just mess it up. Maybe the moral of this story is this:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When the fervor's ablaze in your breast,
And your heart would leap out of your chest,
Try not first to speak.
Try instead this technique:
Let with action the yen be expressed.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Should I have passed the test?</title>
      <link>/blog/should-i-have-passed-the-test</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b29d50bc07b083624e43aff/1529468459845/pexels-photo-210661-e1498097210510.jpeg" alt=""/>
  

<p>I took a biology class in college. I was/am terrible at biology, in case you didn't know, so this example will be perfect. The date of the first exam was coming up, so I began to study in preparation for it.
Question: Should I have passed the test?</p>
<p>The obvious and probably first answer you'd think of is yes, I should have passed the test. We probably default to that because we all want to succeed and we want others to succeed, so it would make sense to think that I should have passed it. Let me throw in an unexpected variable:</p>
<p>Because I was/am terrible at biology, I didn't understand the material for this exam. I put in every last second that I possibly could to master the material, but when I went to take the test, I simply didn't get the material. I totally bombed the test.</p>
<p>Question: Should I have passed the test?</p>
<p>The two questions, although worded identically, are actually talking about two completely separate ideas. The first just refers to the general concept that we should pass our tests, whereas the second is asking whether, given the fact that I was unprepared for the test, I should have passed anyway.</p>
<p>Saying "One should pass one's tests" is akin to saying "One should run 100 meters in 10 seconds." Neither of those statements is inherently fallacious or untrue. We are all capable of achieving whatever goals we wish to achieve. The key is to realize that you can't expect yourself or anyone else to just run 100 meters in 10 seconds on sheer will power. You have to assume that you <em>can</em> pass the test, in the same way that you would have to be able to assume that you <em>can</em> run 100 meters in 10 seconds.</p>
<p>The hard part is the balance between accepting the fact that we aren't perfect and continuing to push ourselves to achieve our goals.</p>
<p>Tip: When you fail, realize that you simply don't have it yet and getting upset about it is a complete waste of time. Just keep working at it. It will come.</p>
<p>In other words: If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Setting Expectations: 4 Tips for Business Owners</title>
      <link>/blog/setting-expectations-4-tips-for-business-owners</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b29d50ac07b083624e43aef/1529468458078/blog-image4.png" alt=""/>
  

<p>Probably the most important principle in business is learning to set expectations. Between employees, non-employee resources, customers, prospects, and family members, a business owner has a lot of expectations to manage. It's crucial that all of those expectations get set and maintained correctly for any business to function. Everyone needs to know what is expected of them and what to expect from you, and that can be overwhelming. That is why most small business owners tend to avoid setting expectations and just pray that they don't end up with a customer or employee that eats up all of their time and resources because of poorly set expectations.
Newsflash: you can't afford to not take this head on.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to help you get started with this:</p>
<h1>It all starts at home</h1>
<p>Your family and your business will always be fighting for your attention. It's very important that each of them understand clearly not only when you will be there, but also when you won't be. Your family deserves your full attention when you're there, and your business deserves (and demands) your full attention when you're there. If you're going to give your full attention to both business and family, you have to have time designated just for work and time designated just for family, and work needs to know to leave you alone when you're with family, and family needs to know to leave you alone when you're at work.</p>
<p>Set boundaries for both family and work, and make sure everyone understands those boundaries very clearly.</p>
<h1>Use your words</h1>
<p>Contracts don't really help anything if the important details aren't made clear <em>before</em> the work starts. All that fine print doesn't help you avoid the headache of the misunderstanding. Just open your mouth and explain the expectations. Have a face-to-face with your family, employees, and even customers and <em>tell</em> them what to expect.</p>
<h1>The best defense is a good offense</h1>
<p>You will be much happier if you <em>avoid</em> the problems that arise from miscommunicated expectations. If you can preempt those problems by setting the expectations well before any work is actually done, you will save yourself countless hours and stress in the long run.</p>
<h1>Don't be afraid</h1>
<p>"Setting expectations" in the business sense basically means telling people that you're going to say no to them in the future about something. Don't be afraid of this. If you've warned them well beforehand that it's going to happen, they'll be expecting it, so they won't be upset about it. If you don't warn them, then it will come as a surprise. Can you think of anyone in your life that would be happy to receive an unexpected "No" from you? I seriously doubt it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Working with your Spouse: Tips to Make it Work</title>
      <link>/blog/working-with-your-spouse-tips-to-make-it-work</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b29d50bc07b083624e43af1/1529468458225/beard-2286440_1920.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>I want to start by saying I've worked with a LOT of business owners whose right-hand man (or woman) was their husband (or wife), and I can count on 2 fingers the number of times it's worked really well. Here are some tips to make it work better. A lot of these principles apply when working with other family members or even old friends.
<h1>Technicolor Type A</h1>
<p>The first thing you need to realize is that you are probably both pretty strong-willed and want to be in charge. You both have a vested interest in the success of the business, and therefore are both going to push very hard for what you think is the right thing to do. You both want it to succeed, and you're both driven to make it happen. Just understanding this won't avert every possible problem that you might face, but it's like that saying: knowing is half the battle.</p>
<h1>Pecking Order</h1>
<p>Probably the hardest thing for spouses to get over in a business setting is the natural and essential pecking order. In fact, some business owners that work with spouses avoid setting that chain of command on purpose. This is a devastating mistake! Here is the plain truth – if you're going to be successful in the marketplace, you <em>have</em> to have a clear leader and a clear follower, and you both have to be on the same page <em>always</em>! That doesn't mean you always have to agree, but one of you has to be in charge in the workplace and the other needs to respect that and get in line when necessary.</p>
<h1>Stop Apologizing</h1>
<p>In business, personal feelings come second. It's important to treat your employees (including spouses) right, but that doesn't mean you don't bring up important stuff just because you might hurt your spouse's feelings. You need to be able to be perfectly blunt and honest with your spouse, and they need to be able to take it and process it effectively – otherwise it simply won't work. I can't tell you how many couple-business partners I've worked with that are constantly apologizing to each other for what they need to say. You wouldn't apologize like that to the college student that you hired as an intern; don't do it to your spouse either.</p>
<h1>See Your Spouse as an Employee (or Boss)</h1>
<p>That brings me to my last point – in the context of the business, you must be able to see your spouse as an employee (or boss), and treat them as such. If you can't do that, or if your spouse will resent you for it, one of you <em>needs</em> to go. And I beg you, for the sake of your marriage, don't let the business come between you. It is <em>not</em> worth it!</p>
<h1>The Hardest Pill to Swallow</h1>
<p>Humility. It's hard enough to be humble, but for some reason it's that much harder when you're in close proximity to your spouse at work. Whether you're in charge or an employee in the business, being humble with your spouse can seem nigh unto impossible. Here's the kicker – most of the time the reason why it's so hard to be humble with your spouse is your own insecurity. Ask yourself the hard question – are you insecure and afraid to be vulnerable to your spouse at work? Do you find yourself getting really defensive and argumentative in meetings, and sometimes at home? If so, you should not be working together.</p>
<p>I think it's possible to work with family members and make it work wonderfully. I've worked directly with family members most of my life, and aside from a few hiccups here and there it has worked out great. It's definitely not easy, but it is possible. It just takes more work J</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad7/1529468453815/17454768_10100930098182816_1035539087_o.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>If you have any kind of customer service arm to your business (which should be all of you) it can be very easy to let your ego get in the way of what your customer really needs. I've worked in the service business my whole career, and I've noticed a trend where the service provider pushes very hard to assimilate the customer into their culture and system. Most of the time I would actually support this practice, in fact would say that the large majority of the time, it is very important to assimilate your customers into your way of thinking and doing things. It makes selling them more stuff down the line that much easier.
However, there are instances when we can let that principle take over and forget that ultimately, what matters is the customer's success. But how do you know if you should be pushing for assimilation or not? Here are some tips that should help:</p>
<h1>Patience, Iago</h1>
<p>If you find yourself struggling with how long it's taking for your customers to adopt your practices and thought-processes, that is a pretty good indication that you are trying to move them too fast. It can be very frustrating, because most customers tend to pick it up fairly quickly. That creates an expectation of quick assimilation, and so when someone is taking longer to get there, we almost want to push them harder to get there faster because we have trained ourselves to not have patience for outliers.</p>
<h1>Explain More, Do Less</h1>
<p>Sometimes your customers won't really understand why you are trying to get them to change the way they do things. It's hard for them to be on board with fast implementation of principles that they don't agree with. It helps to slow down and educate them a little bit on why your way is better, and why they need to make the switch. This can be aggravating as well, because again, most of your customers won't need all of that extra education, so the one customer that does need it can seem like a problem customer.</p>
<h1>What Do They Need? vs. What Do They Need Now?</h1>
<p>This is probably the hardest principle to understand as a services company. We've worked with hundreds or thousands of customers, so we know what our customers really need. For the sake of getting them to what they really need, we tend to de-emphasize the intermediate steps to get there and over-emphasize the end goal. We want to get them from A to Z so badly (and for good reason, too) that we tend to gloss over steps B-Y. Sometimes what your customer needs <em>now</em> is more important than what they need eventually. Sometimes, for the sake of the customer, you have to stop focusing on getting them to Z and start by getting them to B.</p>
<h1>Check Your Ego at the Door</h1>
<p>Your experience has taught you a lot about your industry and your particular niche. You could (and probably should) consider yourself an expert in your field. Don't let that expertise blind you to what your customers actually need. Just because fast-tracking a customer from A to Z was the best thing for 100 business doesn't mean that it is going to be the best thing for the 101<sup>st</sup>. You can't let your experience or your ego get in the way of what is best for the customer. At the end of the day, only the customer matters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Saying “No” to Business is More Valuable than Saying “Yes” - 4 Reasons Why</title>
      <link>/blog/saying-no-to-business-is-more-valuable-than-saying-yes-4-reasons-why</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad9/1529468456802/blog-image2.png" alt=""/>
  

<h1>Exclusivity is More Valuable than Inclusivity</h1>
<p>Nobody wants to be left out of the "cool kids" club. When your prospects understand that you don't take everyone's business, there is an immediate, subconscious desire to overcome whatever obstacles you've prepared for them. If you started your next sales pitch with something like, "Before I tell you what we do, I want you to know that we don't work with everyone," you immediately transform your business into one of those clubs that have bouncers with clipboards and very, very long lines of people eager to get in. Why are those people eager to get in? It has nothing to do with the quality of what's inside. In fact, I'd venture to guess that there is very little real difference between a club with a bouncer and a club without one, except for the bouncer and the long lines.</p>
<p>This concept is not new by any means. It's just really hard to bring yourself to say those words at the very beginning of your sales pitch. You're thinking, "I'm trying to attract as much business as possible, not scare it away." That is the great irony – exclusivity <em>attracts</em> more business than it turns away, and the business that it attracts tends to be better clientele anyway. You want more, better business? Say "no" more often (or at least make people believe that you could say no).</p>
<h1>Personality is More Valuable than Universal Charm</h1>
<p>You won't make it big without ruffling a few feathers. You don't become king without making a few enemies. You and your message will not please everyone; in fact it will upset a few people. The key is to be ok with that.</p>
<p>Many business owners are so petrified of offending their prospects that it holds them back from being themselves in their marketing, messaging, and delivery. And yet those business owners that are truly successful are those that don't really care who they upset, because they have a vision and they are hell-bent on making it come to life. What would Apple be today if Steve Jobs cared so much about pleasing everyone that he was always trying not to offend anyone? It probably bankrupt, if we're being real. Steve Jobs knew what he was going to do, and he went for it. If people didn't like him, they could go buy a PC for all he cared. He had a vision, and he saw it through.</p>
<p>Don't let the irrational fear of losing future business keep you from being who you are.</p>
<h1>Sometimes Scaling Down is More Valuable than Scaling up</h1>
<p>37 Signals, the company that brought you such productivity platforms as Basecamp, Highrise, and Campfire, recently made some changes that seemed to go against all conventional wisdom. They scaled their products <em>down</em>. They have some of the best minds in programing and productivity, and instead of using that to add features to their product, they used it to take many of those features away. They scaled Basecamp back to its barest state, and have been slowly rebuilding it (emphasis on slowly). Most people (myself included) thought they were crazy to pull that much functionality out of their product. What happened, though, was pretty amazing.</p>
<p>Not only did the process of getting at the deepest core of the product make the product infinitely better, it allowed 37 Signals as a company to become a trusted authority on productivity in general. Just as Steve Jobs' obsession with design not only improved his product, but made him a benchmark of design, 37 Signals solidified themselves as a company that not only makes amazing productivity software, but one that deeply understands productivity itself.</p>
<p>Sometimes getting the product <em>right</em> is better than making the product <em>bigger</em>. And getting the product right almost always requires scaling it way down.</p>
<h1>Confidence in Self is Infinitely More Valuable than Respect (read fear) of Prospect and Customer</h1>
<p>Have you ever been to a trade show, talking to a prospective customer, and found yourself fearfully defending your prices, afraid that you might have to give a discount in order to win that business? If you provide an excellent product or service, you should never be apologizing to your prospects or customers about pricing, delivery, methods, any of that. You need to be confident in yourself, and by extension your business. Don't give discounts as a means to win business. Don't throw in pointless bonuses because you are afraid of your own prices. There is nothing wrong with discounting or value added bonuses, but you can't hide behind them as a justification for your pricing.</p>
<p>Part of this comes because you are afraid that you need your customers more than they need you. Therefore, you bend over backwards to satisfy them, and you end up getting taken advantage of. But neither you nor your prospects actually need for you to do that. As soon as your prospects realize that they need you more than you need them, they will flock to you. Your job should be to help them realize that, but you have to be confident in that fact first.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs knew that the world needed his genius way more than he needed any of us. And he was right.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to say "no" to potential business.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I'm really excited about how far voice transcription technology has come in the last decade. I remember when my dad first got the Dragon NaturallySpeaking software, or whatever it was called, for our old PC that was running Windows 95. That program was terrible and you had to speak soooo slowly. It was a nightmare to use. But now, I'm literally dictating this blog post to a Google doc on my phone as I drive home from the gym. It's pretty incredible.
That's true of technology across the board I think. A lot of the technologies that have come have made it easier for us to do things that it was hard for us to do before. And I mean that in the sense that the time it takes to go from nothing to having something is decreased. Because there's some tool or app or device that bridges the gap that used to exist.</p>
<p>Now I see this as both a good and a bad thing. And I guess the main point of this blog post is going to be pointing out the possible upsides and the possible downsides of all this new technology. Because the truth is the technology itself isn't good or bad. Progress is simply progress. It just depends on what the progress does in relation to what you or I are currently doing. And what I mean by that is sometimes progress makes things obsolete. Or worse, sometimes it makes people obsolete. And obsoletion might be the most terrifying thing that anybody can be faced with. And so a lot of times people will oppose technology, or innovation, or progress in general, not because the progress isn't good for humanity, but rather that it's not good for <em>them</em>.</p>
<p>So I'm always wary of people who talk about progress and change in a negative light because to me that is indicative of a person who is trying to hold onto something because it's comfortable, familiar, or easy. Personally, I have always loved change. I remember distinctly the first few times that Facebook started changing its layout. Everybody I talk to hated the new layout. And they all wanted it to go back to the way that it was. But I loved it. Every time they would change the layout, I was super excited to explore the new avenues and nuances of what I was able to do.</p>
<p>I've always liked change and new things. Not just with Facebook, but in all aspects of life. A lot of that has to do with the fact that I don't believe that just because something is tried and true that it's necessarily right. I don't believe that just because "this is how it has been done", that it's how I should do it. And I definitely don't trust anyone but myself to get results for me. That's based on a deep-seated paranoia that I think I've had since birth, as well as a lot of experience with people trying to tell me how to live my life and it just not being the right thing for me.</p>
<p>{this is where we break from the dictated part of the post to me actually writing}</p>
<p>The bottom line is I'm the kind of person that needs to be burned by the stove before I decide to avoid it. I'm the guy that needs to try things for myself, not totally because I'm stubborn (which I am, that's just not the point I'm making now), but rather because I need to <em>feel</em> why things are done a certain way. I need it to be something that comes from within, because one thing I absolutely can't stand is when I can't put my heart into whatever I'm doing.</p>
<p>Aaaaaaaanyway, how does that rant (which is a blog post all on its own) relate back to technology?</p>
<p>Sit tight, and I will tell you:</p>
<p>All change should be embraced as an opportunity for growth. Change should not be feared or ridiculed. Learning, experiencing, being part of something new is how we improve ourselves as a species. Shying away from change keeps the whole of humanity from whatever breakthroughs, whether personal or societal, lie beyond the horizon of that change. Change is not scary. Change is power.</p>
<p>So embrace change, is what I think I'm trying to say. Adopt new technologies. Learn new things. Don't be afraid to be different than you were yesterday.</p>
<p>As an aside, I would refer you to the following blog post by my man Gary V. It hits this right on the head, but from a different angle:</p>

<p>A reimagined version of Collective Soul's "Shine".</p><p>A lot of cover artists take a minimalist approach, stripping the song down to its essentials and playing simple chords with excellent vocalisms.</p><p>I like to be different (because I'm crazy) so this is a small example of a more lateral reimagining of one of the greatest songs of all time.</p><p>Enjoy</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>2 Steps Back, 5 Steps Forward - a business video shot in an unbusiness setting</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/4/9/2-steps-back-5-steps-forward-a-business-video-shot-in-an-unbusiness-setting</link>

<p>This is a video about BUSINESS, shot in an extremely UNBUSINESS setting. Sometimes the best way forward is actually to turn around and reset.</p><p>Sometimes I have my best thoughts when I'm working out. And this is how I work out.</p><ol></ol><p>I was walking my dog one day and these two ladies stopped me and asked which way to Balboa Park.&nbsp;</p><p>I turned around and pointed the way I'd just been coming, and said it's directly that way. So you'll want to:</p><ol><li>Head up this street until it ends</li><li>Then follow it to the left</li><li>Then right when that street is about to turn left again, you'll take a little side path down to the next street</li><li>Turn left</li><li>Follow that all the way up.</li></ol><p>They both looked at me a bit confused, and were like I thought it was easier to get there than that. Then it hit me, if they just turned around, it was two right turns and they were there.</p><p>So I turned them around, said turn right at the next intersection, walk 3 blocks to Sixth, turn right, and then follow that all the way to the park.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's a map so you can get an idea:</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b2a85c32b6a28f608c0a086/1529513432682/Screen+Shot+2018-04-09+at+7.48.58+AM.png.58+AM.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>The point, of course, is sometimes you can't get so caught up in the direction you're going that you don't see an easier and better way of getting where you want to go. Sometimes turning around is faster than trying to muscle through.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Don't Trim Your Nose Hairs with a Chain Saw</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/6/20/dont-trim-your-nose-hairs-with-a-chain-saw</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever woke up in the morning and thought:</p><h1 style="margin-left:40px">Hmmm...my nose hairs are out of control, I wonder if there's enough gas in the chainsaw for a trim?</h1><p>Probably not. I'd imagine you'd go into the bathroom, find the appropriate tool (tweezers, trimmers, etc) for that specific job.</p><p>It's not so much that you <em>don't need</em>&nbsp;a chainsaw, it's more that you don't need it for <em>that.</em></p><p>Why, then, do so many business owners like yourself pay outrageous prices for services they don't actually need?</p><p>I see this all the time - a company really struggles because they have a small operational problem of getting data from one system to another. They shop around for agencies and services to help them solve that problem, and most (if not all) of the proposals that come back are for a job that is WAY beyond solving that one problem.</p><p>It's like if you needed your bathroom sink to be fixed, and the plumber came in and quoted that the entire house needed to be remodeled in order to better optimize the water flow from that sink.</p><p>It's not that the remodel is a bad idea at all. I don't use that analogy to dissuade you from big projects like that at all - it's more that a complete home remodel isn't what you need <em>right now</em>.</p><p>What you need right now is the bathroom sink fixed.</p><p>And then maybe to have a nicer shower head installed.</p><p>And then perhaps the disposal in the kitchen to be cleaned.</p><p>And then once those smaller problems are fixed and the house is running smoother, THEN it makes sense to bring in the big guns for the remodel.</p><p>The real benefit of solving small problems one at a time is the cost to you. Not only is it MUCH cheaper to have an expert come in and solve a specific problem, smaller projects like that take much less oversight from you. The problem is clear, and so your desired outcome is clear, which makes it super easy for someone to come in and solve that specific problem to your exact specifications, with you having to waste your time managing it.</p><p>So please, for the sake of the longevity of your business, don't try to solve the problem of overgrown nose hairs with a chainsaw.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Be You, 100% and Without Apology</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/6/20/be-you-100-and-without-apology</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently ran a promotion. Well, it was more of an "Announcement of Services" if anything, but it ran on LinkedIn and Facebook. On LinkedIn it was sent as a message:</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b2a881788251b2811b16615/1529514661799/Screen+Shot+2018-05-04+at+11.15.02+AM.png.02+AM.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p> </p><p>And on Facebook it was a regular ad, leading to a messaging reply:</p><p> </p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b2a8871f950b773dc236f90/1529514127219/Screen+Shot+2018-05-04+at+11.24.17+AM.png.17+AM.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p> </p><p>Of the 15 people that have responded so far on either platform, 2 of the initial ones had very specific suggestions for how I could "improve" the ad:</p><p> </p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b2a88af1ae6cf72ddb7c72f/1529514168371/Screen+Shot+2018-05-04+at+11.33.09+AM.png.09+AM.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  


  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b2a88c11ae6cf72ddb7cad9/1529514232258/Screen+Shot+2018-05-04+at+11.31.35+AM.png.35+AM.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p> </p><p>There is only one person from those 15 that is likely to become a customer (i.e. pay me money), and he said specifically when I spoke to him earlier today that he loved everything about the way that message was sent.</p><p>Everything from my profile picture:</p><p> </p>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="752.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b2a893d03ce64b38935fb56/1529514310159/Screen+Shot+2018-05-04+at+11.38.37+AM.png.37+AM.png?format=original" alt=" He specifically mentioned that me  not &nbsp;smiling and  not &nbsp;wearing a suit is what caught his attention. "/>  He specifically mentioned that me  not &nbsp;smiling and  not &nbsp;wearing a suit is what caught his attention. [/caption] 
  

<p>...to the way I wrote the message:</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b2a896f575d1fdb848dc23a/1529514448574/Screen+Shot+2018-05-04+at+11.15.02+AM.png.02+AM.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>Here's the punch line:</p><p>People are always trying to make themselves feel important by telling me the "best" way to do what I'm trying to do.</p><p>My experience?</p><p>Those people are wrong and will never give me money. So I always ignore them.</p><p>My customers and prospects (the real ones, the ones that give me money) love it when I am totally and unequivocally myself, because they want to feel like they know me as a person.&nbsp;</p><p>That "unprofessional" profile picture is one of my favorite pictures of myself, and I couldn't care less what anyone thinks about it. It stays.</p><p>My writing style is extremely informal and straightforward. I try to remove as much fluff as I can (my college professors would be proud) because I know that the people I'm writing to only have 3 or 4 minutes to spare on my thing until they have to rush off and put out some new fire. And yes, I apologize right out the gate if I feel like I'm being intrusive.</p><p>Why?&nbsp;</p><p>Because that's how I am. Period. That's what I would do if I was sending a one-off message to anyone, for any reason.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, people absolutely love it. At least the ones that end up giving me money do. The rest, unfortunately, I don't really care about. I don't have enough time.</p><p>Besides, can you imagine trying to do work for a client that you <em>know</em>&nbsp;is judging your communication style and "unprofessional" appearance? That sounds like death. And cancer. In fact, that sounds like death ate cancer, then ate you, then ate a skunk, and now you're just sitting in there, rotting away forever with a skunk and cancer.</p><p>Unpleasant, to say the very least.</p>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p>For a long time, I tended to ignore the surprise and the criticism and revel in the pride, telling myself that since I viewed this newfound lifestyle as a complete positive, anyone that didn't share that view wasn't worth listening to.</p><p>Last night I had a conversation that gave me a different perspective on it.</p><p>So, I wanted to take some time and put down "on paper" what it is about the "Brutal Ballet" that is so important to me and what drives me to get into a ring and try to knock another dude out while he tries to do the same.</p><p>As I started writing, however, it became clear that there is a lot more I want to say than can be summed up in one post (at least not one that people will read), so I'm going to break it up into sections. First I'll set the scene with my back story, and then I'll go through each of my main reasons for fighting, and then do a conclusion post where I wrap it all up.</p><p>Sounds fun, right?</p><h2>Back Story: Ferdinand the Bull</h2><p>This is an excerpt from a real book about a bull that didn't want to fight:</p><blockquote>Once upon a time in Spain...there lived a bull and his name was Ferdinand.</blockquote><blockquote>All of the other little bulls in the pasture loved to run around and butt their heads together, but not Ferdinand. Ferdinand preferred to just sit quietly and smell the flowers. He had a favorite spot in the shade under a cork tree in the pasture. He would sit there all day long and sit just quietly and smell the flowers.</blockquote><blockquote>His mother, who was a cow, asked him if he wanted to play and butt heads like the other little bulls but Ferdinand said no, he preferred to just sit quietly and smell the flowers. His mother, who was very understanding, even though she was a cow, decided to just let him be happy there under the cork tree.</blockquote><blockquote>After a while Ferdinand grew into a big, strong bull. All of the other bulls in the field still ran around and butted their horns together. What they wanted more than anything in the world was to be chosen from the big bull fights in Madrid. But not Ferdinand, he preferred to just sit quietly and smell the flowers. One day, a group of men from Madrid came to the pasture to choose a bull for the bull fight. All of the bulls were so excited and proudly showed off how tough they were by butting their heads together and acting very fierce. Ferdinand knew he would not be chosen so he left to go sit under his cork tree in the shade.</blockquote>

<p>The story goes on to tell how he got sucked into a fight because he freaked out after sitting on a bee, so everyone thought he was the toughest bull in Spain, but then he just sat there in the stadium and refused to fight.</p><p>We actually had this book when I was a kid and I read it quite often, but the real reason I bring this up is that I was often referred to by my family as Ferdinand. I played in a youth soccer league and spent more time chasing butterflies than the ball. I was never really that overtly competitive and I most definitely avoided conflict like the plague.</p><p>So I guess it should come as no surprise that people who grew up with me would consider it slightly odd that I would take up the most directly confrontational sport on the planet.</p><p>I think it's slightly romantic, the notion that Ferdinand would refuse to fight even when he was finally thrust into it. Seeing the lights, hearing the roar of the crowd, smelling the sweat of the matador all had no effect on him. He still just wanted to sit and smell the flowers.</p><p>It's easy to give in to the way that story is told, making it seem like it's not only romantic, but it's also right in some way. It's easy to make that connection since the practice of bullfighting is absolutely ridiculous and inhumane. Ferdinand didn't want to fight, so why should we make him do it? He just wants to sit in the field and smell flowers, and that's sweet, so let's let him do it.</p><p>Most people would probably say that this story has a happy ending, because Ferdinand wasn't forced to fight to the death for the entertainment of a sick group of humans. I disagree, however. Not with the sickness of bullfighting, that's gotta go, but with it being a happy ending for Ferdinand. If he was never challenged to step outside his comfort zone and make something of himself, how would he ever grow as a person?</p><p>How would Ferdinand grow up to be anything different from a 28-year-old man living in his parents' basement playing video games all day? How would he ever learn to be confident in his own abilities and actually play a functioning role in society?</p>

<p>He absolutely wouldn't. He'd become conditioned that the world owed him that little spot under the cork tree with flowers all around. He'd take for granted all that goes into maintaining that field so the flowers grow, and making sure the irrigation keeps that cork tree healthy. He'd completely lose sight of the WORK that goes into the cushy life he enjoys, and one day, when the caretaker gets either too old or too fed up with being taken for granted, Ferdinand would be out in the streets with no skills, no ambition, no ability to make money, and would spend the rest of his miserable existence blaming the world around him for his misfortunes.</p><p>Now, obviously there is a <em>lot</em>&nbsp;to unpack there, which is most of the reason I'm taking 5 posts to do so. So I will explain. No, there is too much. I will sum up:&nbsp;</p><p>So why do I get in the ring and fight?</p><p>Because I realized that getting in the ring is just a metaphor.</p><p><em>Life </em>is the real fight.</p><p>And life <em>is</em>&nbsp;fighting.</p><p>Think about it: life is <em>fighting.</em></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's just you and what you are physically capable of doing with your body and your opponent and what he (or she) is capable of doing with his (hers). And there is something so satisfyingly simple about that.&nbsp;</p><p>In my experience, most of life is convincing other people that you're capable of doing what you say you're capable of doing. In combat sports, you are either better than your opponent (and you win) or you aren't (and you lose). It's that simple.</p><p>There are no excuses to be made, no reasons to be given, no blame to be placed. You show up, do the best you know how, and the result is immediately apparent.</p><p>I've never felt more human in my life than when I'm sparring or fighting, which is another reason why I do both as often as I can.</p><p>There's an interesting correlation that I've noticed between sparring (play fighting used to prepare for real fights) and navigating personal relationships. Funnily enough, I've been in relationships (romantic, platonic, familial, bromantic, etc) my whole life, but I would <em>never</em> have picked up on the interpersonal hacks that literally punching someone in the face has taught me so plainly and clearly.</p><p>First, an explanation of sparring:</p><p>Sparring is simulated fighting. Normally we wear bigger gloves and shin guards, and we tend to go a little easier than we would in a real fight, but the point of sparring is to practice the realtime application of what we've learned from the drills and concepts we've been working on.</p><p>Whether or not you're going to actually participate in a fight, sparring is a great way to improve your skills quickly, not to mention it's probably the most fun you can have with your clothes on.</p><p>The really cool part is how counterintuitive the result of sparring is. You'd think that the act of punching and kicking another person (for fun) would have a negative impact on the personal relationship between the two people, but it's actually the exact opposite. My best friends in the world also happen to be the ones that I hit in the face (and hit me back) on the most regular basis.</p><p>Even further than that, these friends of mine understand that pulling punches does neither of us any good. So, because we both want to improve in the sport, and because we both want to really test ourselves, we hit each other pretty hard. Without malice, of course, but always with a spirit of healthy competition that drives each of us to overcome the adversity we're presented with and perform at our best.</p>

<p>In personal life, I've found the same to be true. Friendships, relationships, family situations: nobody grows if we're not giving 100% all the time. Holding back real feelings only makes for stale, unproductive relationships, and nobody wants that.</p><p>It can be kind of difficult to breach that barrier, though. Most of us have a line that we don't cross with certain people, because we tell ourselves that we're being respectful of their beliefs, feelings, opinions, etc. And most of us have operated under a need to maintain that line our whole lives (and our parent's did the same, and their parents, etc).</p><p>But just like in sparring, if I refuse to bring up a sensitive subject with a friend or family member because I'm afraid of offending them, how will they ever be able to cope with a different person bringing up the same thing with no concern for offending them?</p><p>Of course I don't mean you should blast everyone all the time for all of the thoughts, opinions, or beliefs that you don't personally agree with. Even in sparring, there are levels. Say someone is new to the sport, or new to the gym. What if someone is injured? You don't take the person that just got reconstructive surgery on their knee and just blast their knee into oblivion. You work with them on the level that they are comfortable and ready to work.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes a round of sparring can escalate quite quickly. If I catch you with something, and you immediately come back with something and get me, we can build off that energy and go from light "feeling out" sparring to a full-contact war really quickly. This happens quite regularly. The funny thing is it usually starts out with the two partners saying to each other, "Let's just flow", or "Let's go light." But that competitive spirit in both of them comes out almost immediately and then it's back to war as per the usual.</p>

<p>The point here is that a little competition between humans is not only healthy, it's <em>necessary.</em>&nbsp;I spent a lot of my younger years trying to avoid competition because competition involves confrontation (which I hate), but more and more I'm finding that when I speak my mind, or when I voice unpopular opinions, or when I gently question someone else's opinion for the sake of honest dialogue, everyone grows and everyone wins.&nbsp;</p><p>And on the flipside, every time I "keep my mouth shut" or "leave it alone", I notice almost immediately the opportunity for mutual growth and respect that's been lost.</p><h3 class="text-align-center">So that's the first big reason why I train and fight:</h3><h2 class="text-align-center">I'm a better person because of it.</h2>&nbsp;]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Why Fight? - Reason #3: Fear (part 4 of 5)</title>
      <link>/blog/fight-4</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok for this one, I have to go back in time a bit. All the way back to when I was a wee lad. We used to take a lot of trips to the lake back then and on one such occasion, some of the other boys and I decided to try cliff jumping.</p><p>"Cliff" is a bit of a misnomer. It was more like jumping off a small boulder.&nbsp;</p>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="720.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b3102bd1ae6cf0724f9eaa6/1529872677975/14079709_10157305441640156_8293018239823024077_n.jpg" alt=" That's me on the left there, not long after the cliff jumping experience. "/>  That's me on the left there, not long after the cliff jumping experience. [/caption] 
  

<p>Any case, when it came to my turn, I stepped to the edge of the rock and as I looked down at the water realized that if I didn't jump <em>immediately</em>, then I wouldn't jump at all.</p><p>That moment (which,&nbsp;I'm sure, lasted about half a second), was burned into my mind and I can still remember it vividly today.&nbsp;</p><p>Any time I find myself faced with a situation or task that scares me (which happens <em>all the time</em> ), I am immediately reminded of that moment, and I can say 100% that I have never regretted the times when I've jumped. And at the same time, the times when I've given in to the fear have always led to worse pain than the fear itself.</p><p>I wasn't afraid of Muay Thai at first. In the beginning, it was just an amazing workout with new friends that seemed more genuine than any I'd had in a while. I am now fairly well aware that it might have been the <em>people</em>&nbsp;and not Muay Thai itself that gave that feeling of absolute acceptance, but regardless, I felt like I was finally part of a tribe.</p>

<p>But, as with anything, as you get better at something, more is required of you. And such was the case here - very quickly you graduate from hitting pads and mitts and kicking the bag into partner drills and sparring. Meaning you start getting punched.</p><p>And the better you get at not getting punched, the more you end up working with people with real experience, meaning when you do get punched, the higher the likelihood that it's going to really hurt.</p><p>And then there is the inevitable encouragement to take a fight. Almost like a rite of passage, it's something that everyone <em>should</em>&nbsp;do, and many people that train Muay Thai do it at least once, for the experience.</p><p>And like most things that require a lot of preparation and training, the feeling you get after you've laid it all on the line is incomparable. Knowing that you prepared as best you could and you left everything in the ring is the most incredible feeling, even if you lose.</p><p>Make no mistake - it is terrifying, but that's how I know it's worth it. The fact that it terrifies me is what drives me to keep going.</p>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="2500.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b3102bd1ae6cf0724f9eaa9/1529875890372/usko_0616-z.jpg" alt=" There is nothing quite like this feeling. "/>  There is nothing quite like this feeling. [/caption] 
  

<p>Funny thing is, though, the fear only lasts until the bell rings to start the first round. It builds and builds from the moment I take the fight all the way past weighing in and warming up and sealing the ring. That moment where I look across the ring at my opponent right before the ref tells us to fight is where it all peaks - everything hits me at once. What's going to happen? What if I get hurt? What if I let my coaches and teammates down? What if I choke?</p><p>And then that bell rings, and all of that is gone in an instant.&nbsp;</p><p>And for the next 8 minutes, there is nothing but me and him, and the calm violence that is Muay Thai.</p><p>I've never been more afraid as the moments before a fight starts.</p><p>But I have never been more calm and at peace as when I am locked in a ring with another dude and we're trying to do as much physical harm to each other as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Funny how that works, isn't it?</p>&nbsp;]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Why Fight? - Reason #2: Health (part 3 of 5)</title>
      <link>/blog/fight-3</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an interesting correlation (for me, anyway) between fighting and my overall health. It makes perfect sense - there's "in shape" and then there's "in <em>fight</em>&nbsp;shape". Preparing for a fight means getting ready for as many different possibilities as you can, and most importantly being ready to last longer than the other guy.</p><p>I know that using weight as an indicator for health is generally inaccurate, but in my case it's the best indication. When I'm in shape and in good health, I'm within 7 pounds of 180. When I'm out of shape, eating crap all the time, stressed, and unhappy...let's just say I'm well outside that range.</p><p class="text-align-center">Enter Exhibit A:</p>

</div><p>All the way on the left there, you can see my first real weigh-in using this particular app. I was 215 pounds, and this is after training for an riding in a full Century (100-mile bike ride), which I took quite seriously and trained for over the course of several months. Needless to say, before that I was hovering around 235-240.</p><p>Not a great time for my health. Physical <em>and</em>&nbsp;mental. Talk about body-image issues. I won't even get into the complex that you get as a MAN, knowing you have serious depressions because of the way you look and feeling like you shouldn't but you do anyway. That's a book in itself.</p><p><em>Then I started Muay Thai.</em></p><p>Almost immediately, I started experience what I call "Positive Weight Redistribution". I didn't lose a ton of weight immediately, but I did start to notice my belly, thighs, and face shriveling a bit, and my arms started to develop a bit of tone.</p><p>I say <em>didn't lose a ton of weight immediately</em>, but it was around 20 pounds over 3-4 months. Which for me was significant, especially because I wasn't just losing fat and gaining muscle, I was learning a new skill and gaining confidence. I felt like a million bucks!</p><h3>When It Became A Little More Serious</h3><p>About a year after I started training, something shifted and I started to take it a little more seriously. I think part of it was that I'd made it through the obligatory year of "is this guy going to wash out or stick around" and so my trainers and training partners started to consider me one of the team. I was a regular, and people were used to be being a part of the training schedule and everything.&nbsp;</p><div class="image-gallery-wrapper">

</div><p>Around that time is when Muay Thai sort of became the most important part of my life. I was no longer passively participating as a hobby - I was living to train. All of my friends were training, and everything revolved around preparing for, and then recovering from, each training session.</p><p>I like to believe that my body was responding to my mind becoming more committed to Muay Thai, and decided it was time to shed more of that last layer of padding that it had been carrying around, just in case.&nbsp;</p><p>I also noticed around that time that my resting heart rate dropped significantly, and for the first time in a very long time, <em>I was actually happy</em>.</p><h3>Fight Camps</h3><p>I believe the fight camp is the best combination of perfect training conditions. Not only do fighters tend to have a base fitness level that is usually much higher than the average person, but there are a few bonus variables that make it absolutely ideal:</p><ol><li>Fighting requires power, explosive movement,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;extreme cardiovascular endurance</li><li>The fighter that can create explosive movement, even at the point of complete physical exhaustion, has a better chance of winning</li><li>The neurological and psychological stress of fighting has a similar effect to fighting at extreme altitude</li><li>*Bonus variable - you are fighting another person who is not only preparing for the above, but more importantly to be <em>more prepared than you</em>&nbsp;for the above</li><li>*Bonus variable 2 - your opponent knows that you know that they are trying to out-prepare you</li></ol><p>All of these point to one very important fact about fight camps: you have to physically prepare for the worst possible scenario - that your opponent has limitless cardio and will <em>never</em>&nbsp;get tired.</p>

</iframe>
 
<p>It calls for an intensely grueling training process. There's a reason why even fighters at the very top of the game will push themselves to the point of passing out, throwing up, and collapsing in preparation for a fight. Because they know that their opponent is doing the same, and a sure-fire way to lose the fight is to show up under-prepared.</p><p>On the flip side, however, you can overcome a massive size disadvantage by coming in well prepared and well conditioned. This fight video is a classic example of a smaller guy (me) with better conditioning having a much easier time dealing with a much bigger guy (at the time of this fight I'm sure he had 15-20 pounds on me).&nbsp;</p><h3>The Gray Time</h3><p dir="ltr">As if trying to live up to my philosophy degree, my mind created a situation whereby I was able to prove how important fighting and training is to my health by showing what happens when I stop training for an extended period of time.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll notice a large section of that first image that I've aptly named "The Gray Time". I'm not going to go too far into that story, but I will say that that period of time saw me somewhat compelled to limit my training to once (maybe twice) per week. And you can see very clearly what the result was. Over 15 pounds gained, and I was fast approaching the depression that I hadn't encountered since before I even started training.</p><p dir="ltr">Luckily, I recognized what was happening, and even more fortunately, I live with a woman that has been nothing but supportive of me and what's important to me. So I made a change, and now I'm back, in better shape and more on fire than before.</p><p dir="ltr">In the 4 months since I made that change, I've been in 3 consecutive fight camps, won 2 fights, and lost over 20 pounds (again). I feel amazing, my clothes are too big again, and I am on top of the world.</p><p dir="ltr">Conclusion: fighting is good for my health. And <em>not</em>&nbsp;training is bad for my health.</p><p dir="ltr">Ergo: I train, I fight.</p>]]></content:encoded>
      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There is an interesting correlation (for me, anyway) between fighting and my overall health. It makes perfect sense - there's "in shape" and then there's "in <em>fight</em>&nbsp;shape". Preparing for a fight means getting ready for as many different possibilities as you can, and most importantly being ready to last longer than the other guy.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>Being an Entrepreneur is Like Training For a Fight</title>
      <link>/blog/being-an-entrepreneur-is-like-training-for-a-fight</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/H7ucwzKtN9E?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" height="480" width="854" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">

<h3 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face."</h3><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">That quote is commonly attributed to Mike Tyson, but I'm pretty sure Mike's opponents understood this better than he ever did. Either way, I can personally verify that this is absolutely true.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Once that first bell rings, and the adrenaline hits you, all of your plans go right out the window. It's almost like you lose control of your brain.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In that moment, when it comes down to it, you do what you’ve trained yourself to do. It doesn’t matter what you <em>think</em> you’ve trained yourself to do - you will do what you’re trained to do.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I had three fights earlier this year, and in each of them I thought I was preparing for different things.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The first guy I knew was bigger than me, so I the plan was to move around, throw a lot of kicks, and rely on my cardio. But once that bell rang, all of those plans a schemes went out the window, and I defaulted to what I’d actually been training myself to do: clinch.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The second fight was against a shorter guy. The strategy (which I worked hard on the week of that fight) was to stay long, throw a lot of jabs and teeps, and pick him apart from the outside.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But again. Bell goes ding, and I revert back to clinch.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The third fight, I wanted to do more boxing. But again, once that bell rang, I defaulted back to what was comfortable: clinch.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I go back to what I know because for better or worse, I’ve trained myself to default back to clinching.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The punch line of all of this is that how you react when crisis hits is directly related to the&nbsp;<em>training&nbsp;</em>you've put in beforehand.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You have to train, so that when the crisis hits, you can rely on your&nbsp;<em>instincts</em>&nbsp;to carry you until you can quiet your mind enough to solve the problems.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The worst thing you can do is pretend those days don't (or won't) exist. The people that get knocked out the worst are the ones that don't take their opponent seriously. Same is true for business. The more impervious you think you are to bad times, the more vulnerable you actually are.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The way to win is to prepare yourself.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Winners train for battle.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Losers don't even know the battle is coming.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">What are you training yourself to do?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Stop trying to not do work</title>
      <link>/blog/stop-trying-to-not-do-work</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">For the last decade, we've been brainwashed (myself included, by the way) into thinking that charging more for less work was the way to scale.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hell, I have taught that same principle from stage on multiple occasions. I totally bought into the culture of charging more 'because you can'.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Why do we do that?</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Wanna know what I think? I think it's because we are deathly afraid of the one thing we should be embracing more than anything else:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">WORK</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Why? Because we actually believe that "work" is an entry level position. We believe it's the part of running a business that you outsource.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We're "CEOs", so if we're working 18 hour days, or if we can't travel 4 months of the year, we haven't "made it". Success is defined by how LITTLE we have to work (or so we think).</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Can you imagine if Mohammed Ali had the same attitude toward boxing? Can you imagine him trying to outsource the cardio, the road work, the endless bag rounds, or the jump rope? Do you think for one second that you'd even know his name if he was always trying to do the least amount of work possible?</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I remember training for one of my tournament fights when this really clicked for me. I was watching a video on Instagram of Joe Schilling, a very well-known kickboxer and an idol of mine. He threw up during training because the workout was so intense and he was going so hard.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">That's when it hit me - the training never gets easier. You just get better.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Same thing is true in business. You're never going to do "less work". You're just going to get more done in the time you spend. And what you do in that time is going to get better.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But the minute you phone it in in your business, you're finished. The minute you start to replace yourself for the sake of "personal freedom" or "free time", you're done.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Just like in fighting, there's always a kid that's as hungry or more than you, and if he outworks you, it's all over. You're toast.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Don't phone it in. Forget "lifestyle business".</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Do the f***ing work.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Or you'll get knocked out.</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I realized that I don't really like Moka, French Press, or any coffee other than pour over. Also, living in a 1-bedroom apartment in San Diego, I don't have unlimited space. So I made a decision to trade $300 worth of coffee stuff for a $40 setup and I love it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Entrepreneurship is NOT about "doing whatever you want".   </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sure, you get to choose the general direction of where you want to go, but once you've locked that in, you are extremely restricted in the day-to-day.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You don't get to say,   </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"I want to fight Conor McGregor in 6 months,"   </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">AND ALSO SAY  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"I want to sleep in today and go to the fair and have funnel cake."  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If you decide you want to fight Conor, you give up the freedom to have funnel cake.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You've made the decision about the funnel cake when you make the decision about the fight.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In the same way, when you decide to become an entrepreneur, you don't get to frolick around doing whatever you want (unless you've figured out how to make money frolicking, in which case, please call me and let me in on the secret - I want that shit).  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You either get to frolick or you get to be an entrepreneur.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You either get funnel cake or you fight Conor.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You DON'T get to do whatever you want - you get to do what it takes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Dues of Entrepreneurship - Morning Coffee #9</title>
      <link>/blog/the-dues-of-entrepreneurship-morning-coffee-9</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/64RV2EPjmMM?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" height="480" width="854" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I never liked the idea of "paying my dues". I always thought that was beneath me for some reason.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I just wanted people to notice what I was doing and give me the credit that I thought I deserved.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ironically enough, although I was (and still am) KILLING it in the work I was doing, I hadn't done ANYTHING to deserve the notoriety or credit I was after.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sure, I have always gotten a lot of referrals for business because I do good work, but what I really WANTED was for someone to ask me to speak from stage, or come out and present to 50 staff members, or co-present on a webinar to a couple thousand people.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I wasn't willing (until recently) to acknowledge that the way you get to stage and to cohost and guest blog and all that is by creating a brand, not just by doing good work.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It's not that good work isn't important. It's fundamentally important, and it's the backbone of the whole thing, but it's not going to get you the recognition you're looking for all on its own.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It's like a car engine. You can have the most powerful car engine, but without gas, it's not going anywhere.   </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">By the same token, all the gas in the world isn't going to get you very far if your engine is no good.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So, just like I'd spent a decade patiently and arduously developing my skills on the technology and consulting side, I had to decide to make a decision to make that same journey for my brand.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I have to pay my dues just like everyone else in order to get what I want.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It takes a bit of humility to realize that you have to start back at square one, but I get super excited about it.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Dues of Entrepreneurship are time, energy, and effort.   </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You can't get around paying them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>I knew I was going to leave the Mormon church when I was 12 - Morning Coffee #10</title>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I am usually the first to disregard my own instincts.   </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I love making calculated decisions based on data and analysis.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In fact, my default setting is pretty much always set to "question everything always".  It's especially true of my own thoughts.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But I think maybe I lean too far in that direction.  I've made plenty of decisions in my life that it took me several years to finally put into action. I'm always second-guessing myself.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The potential fallout from taking a hardline stance on something and ending up on the wrong side of it has kept me in limbo way too often (and for way too long).  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I think the reality is that I know the difference between a passing thought that needs to be scrutinized and molded into a mature thought and an instinct that I need to act on.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Maybe it's better to be wrong sometimes and be true to yourself than it is to be "right" and waste time on the hemming and the hawing.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I can say that I'm trusting my instincts more these days. And so far I'm not dead.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So there's that.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The way you feel about what you're doing is soooo closely linked to how well you do it.   </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If you feel like you suck at something, the likelihood that you're going to do it well is slim to none at best.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Keeping a positive attitude can have a MASSIVE impact on your output.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Surrounding yourself with people that you trust can help get you through the days when you think you suck, because those people can remind you of your potential.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The flipside of that coin, however, is that positive attitude alone can't win the game for you.  Nobody ever succeeded around yes-men.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Can you imagine if Floyd Mayweather's coaches and teammates only ever told him how awesome he is? Would we even know his name?  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hell to the naw.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Floyd is who he is because he had people to pick him up when he was down, but those same people beat him down when he was too full of himself.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The same is true for anyone that you know that's been successful.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Having a network of trusted people that can be your support system, but also that can check your ego and your bad ideas is CRUCIAL!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Just because you have a reason or an excuse for why your customers are upset with you doesn't absolve you of the responsibility of fixing it.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I can't tell you how often I've been working with a client, something broke, and although it wasn't directly my fault, I had to take responsibility for fixing the problem.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Even if there is no way that I could have foreseen that particular issue, it fell under the scope of my responsibility, and therefore I was responsible.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">At the end of the day, that relationship is not about me. It's about the client.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Even more than I'm responsible for what actually happens for my clients, I am responsible for how my client feels about it.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Just like in this situation, where our complex couldn't have foreseen what happened (let alone that it would happen 3 times), they were still responsible to us to make sure that we FEEL like it's being resolved.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And by the way, you can never get away from that responsibility. After something like that goes wrong, you are always responsible for the fact that it happened.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Most of the time that means you have to step up your communication, and sometimes it means you actually have to deliver more in order to make up for the difference.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It's not very exciting, but it's part of the game.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">At the end of the day, it's about the CUSTOMER, not about you.   </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Put yourself in THEIR shoes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>That time I quit marketing - Morning Coffee #14</title>
      <link>/blog/that-time-i-quit-marketing-morning-coffee-14</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/t6qCNwO5FoU?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" height="480" width="854" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I have a sneaking suspicion (based only on my own experience) that most frustration is actually based in insecurity.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">For example:  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">At the beginning of 2017, I quit the marketing game altogether.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I liked to say to myself that it was because I was fed up with the charlatanism and douchebagery that is so commonplace in the marketing world.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And that was kind of true.   </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Chicanery doth abound here.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">However, the larger reason why I left was out of fear.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I had one major contract that was going away, and with it the bulk of my income.   </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I hadn't done any marketing for myself, didn't have any leads in the pipeline, and had an "opportunity" to go do something else.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I put opportunity in quotes because although I am incredibly grateful that I had that experience, I was really only using it as an excuse to not do the hard, grinding work of building my business up the right way.   </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Then, 5 months later, I made the same insecure decision again.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I was offered a job back in the marketing space, which seemed at the time to be a step up. Making way more money than I'd ever made before, and in theory, only doing the things that I like doing.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I took the job, thinking that I was making a financial decision. Really, I was making a decision to avoid the grueling work that is necessary to make money as a kickboxing instructor.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And then finally I rounded out the trio of insecure decision making by leaving that job. I told myself it was because I was being required to do too much and it wasn't worth it, but really it was because I wasn't willing to do the hard work necessary to make the position fit.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">All things considered, I don't regret any of those decisions, because I wouldn't be where I am today if I hadn't been through those situations and made those mistakes.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But now, as I embrace the grind, as I lean into the 12-hour days and everything that goes along with building a brand, I see how my insecurity had more to do with those decisions than anything else.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Not that the insecurity is gone, by the way. The difference is now I'm hustling in spite of the insecurity, instead of trying to skirt around it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>That job I had before Infusionsoft - Morning Coffee #15</title>
      <link>/blog/that-job-i-had-before-infusionsoft-morning-coffee-15</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/yG2LGXKLhws?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" height="480" width="854" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In this episode of Morning Coffee, I tell the story of my first real job (pre-Infusionsoft).  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">My little brother, Craig, and I, worked for a guy making copies of antlers.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Yep, you read that right - antlers.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As in deer antlers.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Lots of fun anecdotes in the story (definitely you should check it out), but there was one thing I mentioned that I want to call out.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When I left working for that guy to go start work at Infusionsoft, I didn't know that it was polite to give 2 weeks notice.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And so I didn't.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Obviously, if it came down to a choice between giving two weeks and working at Infusionsoft, I'd make the same decision again.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But that wasn't the case.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I just didn't understand the way things worked, and I wasn't very good at empathy.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Now, it's not like this guy's business went under because of me leaving. It's not like anyone died or anything. In fact, given all the context, I don't think most people would think I did anything wrong.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Regardless, it was a selfish, dick move, and I regret it to this day. I wish I'd given him the two weeks.  </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The point is, "looking out for number 1" isn't always the best way to approach things.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Alcoholics or addicts of any kind are taught to completely remove the offending substance from their life. And stay away from them like the plague and create an alternative lifestyle because they are powerless. For some reason, that particular vice has power over them.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And I think for me, it's credit.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Credit, both the financial and metaphorical version of credit, has been a huge vice, something that I've never really managed well. I've really abused it and I haven't treated it right, because I don't really understand what it actually is.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The idea of credit has given me a false sense of affordability around things that are not affordable. This idea of credit leads me to believe that even though I have no cash, I still have money.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Part of that is just a lack of education. But I think I think a lot of addiction comes from a lack of proper education.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When I first started drinking, I was terrified that I was gonna become addicted immediately because I thought I had an addictive personality. But I've had so much education around the dangers of of alcohol addiction that I feel like I have power over it.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">With finances, though, I think a lot of the reason why I'm in the financial position I am right now is because personally, I don't understand how money works.&nbsp; I have always been of a mind that money is just numbers, it's just a number in an account somewhere. And that's it. And I’ve overly simplified what money actually is to the point where I don't have any real understanding of the consequences of abusing it.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I had this attitude: pay a credit card because that's money I get back. So I prefer to pay a credit card bill over some other bill like insurance or whatever because the credit card bill is money that I can use again.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The problem with that is I consider my cash plus my credit as my cash limit. So I’m always maxed out on all my cards.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I have always been, as literally as you possibly can be, living paycheck to paycheck</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Here’s how I plan to solve that:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I'm going to drastically reduce my personal salary in the business,</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I'm going to plan out, in very realistic terms, the growth of the business: what I want to have happen over the next 3, 6, 12 months. And based on my personal ability to actually get myself there, I'm going to give myself performance reviews. So essentially, every quarter, I'm going to take a look at my performance. And if I hit all of my numbers at all my metrics, then I'm gonna get a raise. So that's how I build my own personal income.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But the important thing is that I'm only going to be doing reviews every quarter, which means raises aren’t going to happen every month. In fact, I think it's actually a full year to get to a realistic salary.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Everything and everybody in a business needs to have a metric is that they are responsible for. So if they don't hit their numbers, the compensation goes down, or at least doesn't increase.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I have been pondering junctions like this where I've had some sort of mental breakthroughs and some sort of new understanding a new new lease on life. But I have these experiences where I'll think my way to a solution.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And historically, I have a tendency to think that my work is done once I've thought of the solution. Like somehow just coming up with the idea is enough, and I should be rewarded in some way for my ingenuity. And I don’t do the same for the execution of the idea.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And it's an interesting, contradiction. Because I have always prided myself on being very focused on execution.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And yet, for some reason, with a lot of these ideas, I never end up making it past the planning phase. I'll get really gung ho on this idea, this thing that I decided I'm going to go do and then I just give up. Like I've used all my energy on coming up with the idea and none of my energy actually doing it.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The key is in the execution. Don’t stop with just an idea.</p>]]></content:encoded>
      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In this episode, I finally start to realize some of what I’ve been doing wrong that ended up putting me in the situation I’m in.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Also, cigars and things :)</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>Infusionsoft: The Early Days - Morning Coffee # 16</title>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It's crazy to realize how much my early days at Infusionsoft have influenced the rest of my life.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When I started, there were 7 of us:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">4 Brothers (Scott, Eric, Brad, and me)</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">1 In-Law (Clate)</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">1 Neighbor (Tara)</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">and Jeremy</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I don't believe Jeremy was related in any way, but he might as well have been. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I always knew that Infusionsoft started as a "family" business, but I didn't appreciate how true that was until this morning.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A lot happened back then, but as I look back, there are two extremely important lessons from the first few months working there that have stuck with me all the way until now.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And they kind of define me in some ways.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The first is a lesson from Brad, and it's broken into two parts:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">1. How you format emails to customers matters just as much as what you say in them.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I don't know if Brad was consciously creating a system back then, or if it was just instinctual, but we had a very specific format for how emails were formatted.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Spaces between paragraphs, not too much wording, short, to the point.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I can still type "Let me know if you have any other questions" with my eyes closed because of the muscle memory I developed then.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">2. If you exchange more than 2 emails with a customer, call them. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It's very easy to use email as a way of putting off the real work, which is digging in with the customer and fixing the problem. The phone takes away your hiding place.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It didn't matter back then if it LOOKED like we were on top of things with our customers - all that mattered is if we were actually solving their problems.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The second lesson came from Eric. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I am almost certain that he wasn't trying to teach me anything, but regardless, he did.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Eric never let me get away with asking a question poorly. If I didn't have enough information or didn't phrase the question in a way that made it easy for him to answer, I was sent back to get the proper info.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I got really good at translating what the customer was saying into speak that Eric could work with.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And because Eric and I worked about 5 feet from each other, I had to get good at doing that really fast.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">That ability to act as a translator between people that are frankly speaking different languages has helped me immensely in my career. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Not only that, I have become extremely good at getting what I need from people that I've never met before because I understand how important the context of the question is.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The way you get answers is by making it easy for the other person to answer.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I will forever be grateful for that time in the early days and what it taught me.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And the crazy part is - this is just from the first couple of months! There is SO MUCH MORE that I learned from the rest of my experiences.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Infusionsoft: The Early Days Vol. 2 - Morning Coffee #17</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_ekBHCnUFaE?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" height="480" width="640" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The friction that exists between sales and fulfillment is, although annoying for both parties, integral to growth. That's especially true for a fledgling tech company like Infusionsoft in the early days.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">After Dave and Cody joined the team, I remember there being a good deal of animosity between us (the support/training/fulfillment team) and sales.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">They were so focused on making the sale that they would promise things that we (the support team) weren't fully prepared to deliver.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">At the time, I was more than a little pissed off about it. And if memory serves, I was fairly vocal about it as well.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But luckily for everyone involved, my complaints were largely ignored.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It would have been really convenient for ME if they hadn't asked me to step outside my comfort zone and do new things. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But looking back - the only way that we could possibly have grown as much and as fast as we did is by doing more to get the sale.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And in retrospect, it wasn't just about the revenue from the sale (although let's be honest, that doesn't hurt). It was about developing the company by inserting ourselves into more actual businesses so we could discover what we needed to do as a company.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We needed to be implementing the software for real businesses so we could really test what worked and what didn't. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And because Clate's vision wasn't just to serve a few companies in big cities in the US, but to serve ALL small businesses EVERYWHERE (I might be overquoting here but it helps make my point), we needed to make sure that what we were selling them was actually going to help them.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I wasn't thinking big enough. I wanted things to not be hard. I wanted things to fit into a box.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I wasn't willing to eat crow (to quote Gary Vaynerchuk) for the sake of a bigger vision, because I didn't see it.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">That's a lesson that's taken me almost 15 years to really learn. It wasn't until I fully committed to building my own consultancy and brand that it finally clicked for me:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You. Gotta. Think. Bigger.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There's nothing wrong with thinking small and being ok with it. But when what you REALLY want is to legitimately have a voice on a global scale (like I do), you HAVE to think bigger. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You can't become a billion dollar company if you're not willing to do the work required to get there.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You don't become Nike if you're not willing to make shoes that suck.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You don't become Kevin Hart if you're not willing to get booed off stage.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You don't become Floyd Mayweather if you're not willing to lose.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But once you commit to the larger vision, to the bigger picture, those things become insignificant. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When you realize that what you are trying to do is so much bigger than each individual at-bat, everything becomes a stepping stone to the eventual goal.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But you won't acheive that goal without going back to the plate to swing at whatever life throws.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Think bigger.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Acheive more.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">ARCHIVE FOOTAGE ALERT!</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Today's episode of Morning Coffee features some archive footage of the original Infusionsoft team. Kyle Leavitt, Nathan Leavitt, Jeremy Gurr,Tara LaRue Stradling, Eric Martineau, Scott Martineau, Aaron Halderman, Cody Jones, TJ Lorenzen, and the ever-present cameraman, Clint Garner.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">"Company Culture" has become more and more of a commonplace consideration for companies. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Seems like nowadays every company has their equivalent of an "open floor plan" or "cereal bar" or "game room".</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And although I firmly believe that culture is a crucial part of a company's growth and expansion, I don't think people really understand what it actually is.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The culture that we built at Infusionsoft wasn't something that we created and forced people into. Infusionsoft's "Cereal Bar" wasn't something that we came up with as a way to boost morale.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It came because everyone who worked at Infusionsoft in the early days loved to eat cereal. Like loved loved. A lot.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So it made perfect sense that our cereal obsession would grow with the company. It was a natural extension of a shared interest (or in our case, obsession).</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But more important than any of the "perks" of the culture, the leadership at Infusionsoft (Clate, Scott) has always been focused on the employees as individuals. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">They understood that the best way to grow their company was to empower each employee individually.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In the video I talk about how I was given some time off on short notice to pursue activities that were important to me at the time.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Clate took me aside on several occasions and asked me what I really wanted to be doing to see if there was a way for me to expand my actual interests into more than just answering support questions.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Culture starts with people, and that's something that I always felt was the case when I worked at Infusionsoft. It wasn't something that was imposed on us, it was just a natural extension of who we were at the time.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So if you want to create a culture that is people-focused, you have to be a person that is people-focused. Then attract other people that are also people-focused. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Then you have a culture that is people-focused, not because you told everyone to be people-focused, but because everyone was already people-focused when they got there.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>That One Time My Video Took Down The Infusionsoft Website - Morning Coffee #19</title>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So there was this one time that I can back into the support office after getting a drink of water. We had a little dowel that we used to use in meetings as the "Talking Stick".</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I picked it up and started drumming on the chair and on my cup and on the desk and it turned out that Clint was recording the whole thing.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A couple of weeks later, I uploaded the video to what I thought was my own website, but turned out to be the main directory of the Infusionsoft website.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Short story shorter, the main website was entirely replaced with the video.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In retrospect, all things considered, it wasn't that big of a deal. Our website didn't get a ton of traffic at the time, and it has not had an adverse effect on the long-term growth and longevity of Infusionsoft as a company. But at the time, I am sure that it was not a pleasant situation.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Since then, I've been involved in a lot of situations where something is displayed or sent that is incorrect. An email get sent with an improperly formatted subject line, a video is posted to a blog post that is incorrect, or a headline is misleading on a website.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But in every one of those situations, the immediate emotion made the situation seem much worse than it actually was. And time, as it always does, proved to everyone that what we thought mattered didn't.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I think as entrepreneurs we need to remember the mantra, "Nobody cares", and apply it much more freely in our day-to-day lives.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Because the truth is, nobody cares.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>What I Did After I Left Infusionsoft the FIRST Time: Morning Coffee #24</title>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A lot of people say you should make your goals public. I think the idea is that you feel more accountable when someone else knows what you’re trying to do.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Personally, I don’t like doing this any more. I used to share my grand plans and huge goals, but recently I’ve shifted to letting my actions tell people about my goals.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You have to be careful with goals - sometimes saying your goal out loud can trick your brain into taking credit for the goal before you’ve even gotten started. It’s such an emotional release to verbalize your vision, sometimes it can kill the drive and motivation to actually go and achieve it.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Now, only when a goal is mostly achieved do I feel worthy of saying that it is a goal. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I tell myself that only when I accomplish my grand vision can I let people will know about it. I have found that it is a better way to achieve my goals AND harness that boost you get from sharing your vision with others. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And it’s kind of uncomfortable! I hate being misunderstood, and when people don’t really get what I’m trying to do, I want to lay out the whole plan so they completely understand how BRILLIANT I am.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But the truth is, I’m not brilliant until I pull it off.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I can explain how I’m going to do this and that and get these results and all this, but until I actually DO it, it doesn’t mean anything.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It doesn’t matter what you PLAN to do.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It matters what you’ve DONE.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Number One Killer of Long-Term Creativity</title>
      <link>/blog/the-number-one-killer-of-long-term-creativity</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">People spend countless hours and energy building their “setup”, thereby rendering themselves immobile when it comes to the actual act of creation. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sometimes it manifests as buying actual peripherals for their computer setup (the latest monitor, the nicest MacBook, the best webcam, the nicest microphone, etc).</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sometimes it’s a little less subtle. Sometimes people are always looking for ways to repurpose what someone else has done, instead of trying to create something of their own. How many millions of dollars have been spent on “Copy Swipe Files”, in an effort to short-cut the path to writing copy? How many thousands of hours have been spent at conferences taking notes to try and reverse-engineer someone else’s funnel or business?</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When did we all become so afraid of laying ourselves bare and just being who we are?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I have a personal example of this (it’s the video above)</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">About 5 years ago, I decided to start writing some music. It had been about 10 years since I’d written anything, and it felt long overdue.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I knew that I had ideas that would make for good songs, but I was also convinced that I wasn’t a performer, so I created the songs the same way I’ve done a lot of things - by piecing together smaller sections, fitting them together, rearranging them, and them making them into a song.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It’s like instead of writing a song, I wrote a riff, a verse, a chorus, and a bridge, and then tried to assemble them into a song as best I could.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And in fact, I was so thoroughly convinced that I’d never be a good performer, I never (not once) performed the song all the way through, even to myself.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Once I’d recorded the component parts, I let that be it.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And then, yesterday, I sat down and decided to actually play the song.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So the video above is the very first time EVER that this song has been performed all the way through.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And I’ll tell you what - I like that song way more now than I did when I originally wrote it. It feels more like it’s part of me because I got over my need to hide behind Garageband and the drums and the arrangement of it.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It’s a good song, and I performed it pretty well, and that was ME. It wasn’t the guitar, or the instrumentation, or the drum track, it was ME.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">That’s the difference. When you decide to start your own business, you give up the privilege of passing anything off to anyone else.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Everything comes down to you. Own it. Be comfortable in your own skin. Strip away all the unnecessary stuff and just BE.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It’s more satisfying, trust me. </p>

      <title>Maybe Peripherals Aren't ALL Bad - Morning Coffee #26</title>
      <link>/blog/maybe-peripherals-arent-all-bad-morning-coffee-26</link>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I've raved against depending on peripherals lately, but I think there is a caveat to that. I think depending on tools and gadgets can be fine if they are actually essential to the finished product.<br><br>But most of the time, we just hide behind them in an attempt to hide the actual product.<br><br>I have been as guilty (if not MORE) than anyone of hiding behind fancy gizmos so that the real me wasn't exposed, because I wasn't very confident in myself.<br><br>But at the same time, I have always DEMANDED of myself that I can be capable of doing anything, from anywhere, at any time. And those same tools that I've hid behind and used as an excuse have been crucial to my ability to hold myself to that standard.<br><br>So I guess I consider those tools and gadgets to actually be a part of me, an extension of me. They allow me to scale myself beyond what most people are capable of.<br><br>But it forces me to walk a fine line between depending on those peripherals to the point where the core content is hidden and using those peripherals as what they are: tools.<br><br>It's like a glove or a hat. Those can become extensions of who you are (think Michael Jackson's glove, or even the hats that I've been wearing a lot lately), but they are not who you are.<br><br>They can help make a point, but they are not THE point. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So maybe the point isn’t quite as extreme as get rid of all your peripherals, but rather, make sure you’re using them for what they are.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If you wanted a meatball sub, how many Subways would you be willing to visit in order to get it?</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Seriously, think about it.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Let’s say the first subway you go to is out of bread.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The second is out of marinara sauce.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The third is out of meatballs.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The fourth is out of cheese.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Maybe you think after the second store, you’d probably just pick a different sandwich that they DO have.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Fair enough.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But what if it’s not YOU that wants it, but your pregnant wife? She has that craving, and nothing will satisfy it but a meatball sub from Subway.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And by the way, you can’t cheat and leave off any of the ingredients. Pregnant women (I’m told) can smell the difference before you even open the bag.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Methinks you’d be willing to hit every store on Yelp and off Yelp trying to find it.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Why don’t we treat our businesses that way?</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">How many different ad strategies are you willing to try to get your offer right?</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">How many different variations of the webinar slide deck are you willing to test?</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">How many different email subject lines are you willing to try to find the one that converts the best?</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sometimes you’ll get it right on the first try. Sometimes the first store you go to will have all the ingredients to make the perfect meatball sub. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But if you’re not at least willing to go to another store to get it right, you’re working towards the wrong aim as a business owner. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Getting it right on the first try is not something to strive for.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Get it right eventually. Test, learn, iterate, and innovate. (For example, buy the bread from the fourth Subway and bring it back to the first)</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Если это понимаешь, молодец.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I imagine most of you went straight to Google on that one (unless you already understand Russian, in which case I already congratulated you).</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When I learned Russian, I was forced to go deeper than just the words they were using. Russians have an entirely different way of speaking. Everything from the way the sentences are structured to the inflection of the sentences.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If I tried to just replace English words with Russian words, but keep everything else the same, nobody would understand me. And I know this, because the first 3 months in Ukraine, that was the case.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I would just think of what I wanted to say in English, and then translate as many of the words as I could into the Russian version, and then speak it.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But there is SO MUCH nuance in the way that Russians speak their language.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I learned very quickly (by listening intently) that you can’t just translate the words and expect people to understand.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I had to learn how to translate the entire concept. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">For example - in English, we’d say:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">“Would you like some coffee or tea?”</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Here’s how you’d say that in Russian:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">“Чай, кофе будешь?”</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Literally, that translates to “Tea, coffee will you be?” (check it on Google, you’ll see).</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And yet that is how they would say it.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And even if someone has lived and worked in Moscow for 20 years, they still won’t be able to speak as natively as someone who was born there. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There are subtle nuances that only a lifetime of speaking that language, without anything else to clutter the way you think or speak, would allow you know.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">That’s why I’m so grateful to Infusionsoft for giving me so many chances in the early days, because automation was and is my first and only language in marketing and business.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Later, I’ll tell stories about how understanding the structure of  languages has helped me navigate some tense situations. But for now, I’m just grateful to have been given the opportunity that I was.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Life, Lemons, and a Change of Scenery - Morning Coffee #22</title>
      <link>/blog/life-lemons-and-a-change-of-scenery-morning-coffee-22</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/kO3bBeY9JyA?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" height="480" width="640" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When life gives you lemons….</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I’m not sure there is a more intensely platitudinous (how’s that for a GREAT word, eh?) saying. There are lot of good ones, but in my opinion, this one takes the cake.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And yet - if you look past the cliche, and look past all of the empty uses, there is an extremely valuable (and practical) lesson.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The last week it’s pretty much been raining lemons over here. We moved apartments, which isn’t really a lemon in and of itself, but it does take time and energy to do. Moving also requires transferring services which requires a modicum of coordination and organization. Enter the lemons:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">1. I planned to have the internet service switched from apartment A to apartment B on a Saturday morning (we’d moved most of our furniture into the new unit, so we were just waiting for the internet to be moved so we could bring down the computer and desk, etc.) </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">2. I double checked with AT&amp;T to make sure that the service would be transferred and everything would be ok. I was assured that it would be fine, and that I just needed to wait until 2pm. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">3. 2pm came and went. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">4. I called AT&amp;T, they said the service order couldn’t go through because of a billing issue. Fair enough, I’d missed the notification on that.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">5. I resolved the billing error, called them back, assuming they could just push the self-install order through right then.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">6. They said they couldn’t push the order through until the next Wednesday. I immediately gained a whole deeper level of understanding for the old Brian Regan “Phone Company” bit. So we decided to leave the desk and equipment upstairs where the internet was still working until the next Wednesday.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">7. On Tuesday night I moved all of the computer equipment down.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Wednesday morning, I called again to ensure the service would be turned on as scheduled, and the automated system said it would be turned on the NEXT Wednesday, but that the service in the other unit had been successfully turned off. (Fun times)</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">8. I found my way to a live rep, who said that the internet was supposed to have been turned on the day before, but their system had made an error, and he couldn’t see exactly why it wasn’t on. He also informed me that the self-install option wouldn’t work, and they needed to send a technician out, but that the earliest they could send someone was the next day. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">9. I worked from my phone that day, and waited until about noon the next day when the tech finally showed up. Of course, when they turned on the internet, they downgraded us from 1000mbps internet to 5mbps. Not sure if you have experienced 5mbps internet in the last decade or so, but it flat out doesn’t cut it. So I was back working from my phone while I contacted their support to get everything back how it was before. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Woke up the next day, positive attitude, carpe diem, all that. Jumped on my computer, network speed test has it at 50mbps (not nearly where it’s supposed to be but manageable). And then the fire alarms start going off. The dog really doesn’t like that.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">10. So we go outside, work from the phone (again) and try to figure out a way to sell 12 GALLONS of lemonade from all the lemons from the week.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">About this point, I realized this very important point:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If’ it’s not one thing, it’s something else. Life doesn’t hand out lemons occasionally. Life is just a constant stream of lemons. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The question is, are you going to complain about it, or just make the lemonade and get on with it?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Sugar PSA - Morning Coffee #23</title>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Public Service Announcement Regarding Sugar </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We take a slight break from our usual Morning Coffee show for a PSA about sugar :)</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In the span of my life, science has changed its mind about sugar about 12 times.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Then, more recently, it became common knowledge that some of the early “science” was influenced heavily by parts of the food industry that were heavy on added sugar in their foods.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I haven’t done my homework on reading the studies or the research, but here’s what I know:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I’ve paid a LOT more attention to my health, diet, physique, and energy over the last 5 years or so. I’ve kind of had to.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In that time, I’ve noticed a couple of things about sugar that have been true (for me) every time.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sugar in any form is HELPFUL for fueling and recovering from an intense workout (emphasis on intense)</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When not paired with intense exercise, sugar consumption causes me to sleep more hours (but feel less rested)</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Every time I’ve made an effort to restrict my sugar consumption, I’ve lost on average 10 pounds within 3 weeks.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Everything else tastes better when I’m restricting my sugar consumption.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The big caveat here is this:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Restricting sugar consumption is HARD. Everything has added sugar. Like, EVERYTHING.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I’m not even going to take this any further. At this point I feel like you can come to your own conclusions about that.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">PSA over :)</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I seriously injured my knee when I was in Ukraine. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I got there right at the beginning of the coldest winter in almost 50 years. Snow, ice, the whole 9.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Being an AZ boy, these concepts were extremely foreign to me. I had no idea there’s a difference between walking on pavement, walking on freshly fallen snow, and walking on roads where the snow has compacted into ice.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The thing is, in that third situation, the ice is usually disguised with a thin layer of snow, making it really easy to mistake for freshly fallen snow (especially to a n00b like me).</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Long story short, I had a few missteps that resulted in some pretty nasty falls, which messed up my knee bad enough that I had to come home for surgery.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Had I taken the time to really get a good understanding of my new environment, had I not ASSUMED that everything was always going to be exactly like I was used to, I may have avoided what turned out to be a pretty terrible experience.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I learned my lesson a bit better later, when I started fighting.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If you go into a fight (or even just a sparring session), with ANY assumptions about how your opponent is going to perform, you’re just asking to get punched in the face.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Even if you’d sparred with the same person every week for a year straight, assuming they are going to do exactly what they did last week just gives your opponent the upper hand. Your opponent’s assumptions about what you’re going to do is the EASIEST thing to exploit in a fight.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And here’s the punch line - life is like the perfect sparring opponent. Life doesn’t make mistakes. Life is REALLY good at exploiting your assumptions.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The only way to gain the upper hand in the battle with life is to make NO assumptions.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">No matter what you have done, no matter who you are, no matter your history, life will always have an unexpected trick up her sleeve, and if you’ve let life lull you into that false sense of security, it’s going to crack you with something when you least expect it.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And it’s the unexpected punches that do the most damage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I don't know why I'm still surprised when I find out that people don't always think exactly like me.<br><br>I should know better - I've left 3 companies, a marriage, and a church - all at least partly because one or both of us couldn't get on board with the way the other was thinking.<br><br>And yet, life has a way of continuing to put people and situations in our path to remind us of simple things like this.<br><br>It goes deeper than just creative differences or simple squabbles.&nbsp;<br><br>Sometimes, people approach a problem exactly the opposite way that you'd approach it. In fact, some people think that the way you do things, the only way you can THINK to do things, is flat out WRONG.<br><br>As business owners, that leaves us with a lot of responsibility. In order to get other people to buy our stuff, we have to effectively communicate WHY they should do so. And in order to do that, we have to understand how to give people simple principles that they can understand.<br><br>It can be extremely frustrating, because it can take FOREVER. In fact, sometimes you can spend months on end trying to get someone to understand 1 principle.<br><br>But just like you can't force a horse to drink, you have to be willing and able to meet people where they are before trying to teach them.<br><br>People don't want to change, and they really like the way they think. It takes EXTRA work to get people to appreciate and accept a different way of thinking. Depending on how much you're trying to get someone to change their mind, it might require events that are beyond your control to push them over the edge.<br><br>Above all else, you need to be patient and willing to keep repeating yourself until it sinks in. Either that or you need to be willing to let go when people simply won't change their minds. As right as you think you are, they think they are right just as much.<br><br>And don't be surprised when someone says that the way you think is diametrically opposed to the way they think. It's WAY more common than you think. (that happened to me, and I was way more surprised than I should have been)</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Remove the Friction - Morning Coffee #28</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/11/19/remove-the-friction-morning-coffee-28</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/09WGAuBzGBI?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" height="480" width="854" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The number one obstacle to forward motion in any endeavor is friction.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We expend a lot of energy to overcome the friction in our lives, but we tend not to do much to remove the friction altogether.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We set goals, we develop discipline, we push and push and overcome, but think how much further we'd go, given that same amount of energy, if the friction was reduced by half?</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I have experienced this in so many different ways and across so many years that it's become extremely clear to me:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Friction is like putting a governor on your car. It's an actual limitation. It may not limit the destination itself, but it can make it MUCH more difficult and time consuming to get there.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I think most of us can point to the major sources of friction in our lives. Negative people, overbearing bosses, government regulations, etc. And there are plenty of people talking about how to handle that friction. Get rid of negative people, quit your job, find somewhere else if your government won't allow you to do your thing.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But the friction that is the most damaging in the long term is the friction that is more subtle. It's less obvious, less dramatic.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">For example: </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">1. Do you BELIEVE you can do what you're trying to do?</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">2. How do you FEEL about your ability to perform?</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">3. Are you providing yourself with the resources you need to feel positive and believe in yourself?</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">4. Do you KNOW where the friction is coming from?</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">5. Are your actions yours (or are you living out someone else's ideal)?</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Take it from me, these "hidden" sources of friction slow you down way more over the long term than the more "dramatic" sources. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ask yourself those questions and seriously answer them. It might seem "woo-woo" or "hippy-dippy", but I promise if you find those hidden sources of friction and get rid of them, you'll notice the difference.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>"There's No Money In Music" - Morning Coffee #29</title>
      <link>/blog/theres-no-money-in-music-morning-coffee-29</link>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I came out of high school really wanting to go into music education. I wanted to be a choir teacher at some junior college somewhere, and eventually get the opportunity to conduct a university choir.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And I was GOOD, by the way. Still am, although I'm out of practice.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But somewhere along the line, I let someone convince me that there was no money in music.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And from that moment on, it became "clear" to me that the right choice was to pursue law, and leave music behind altogether.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">At the time, I figured I knew enough about how life worked that the decision to abandon the music and do law was the "right" choice.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If only I knew then what I know now.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It's not that I regret where I've ended up. I am really happy with my life. My experiences have shaped me into who I've become. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But I can't help but wonder whether I'd have become a better version of myself if I'd stuck with what I wanted to do.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The truth is, there was no possible way for me to know how my choice back then was going to work out for me. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But I was CONVINCED, not only that I was making the right decision, but that it was the ONLY right decision.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And since then, I've been in so many situations where I've been absolutely convinced that something is true, only to find out later that I was completely mistaken.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We can't really know anything for certain - the math is too big.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There are way too many variables to consider for us to actually think we can predict any outcome.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And yet we do it all the time. We make decisions based on these "informed" hypotheses that are really just uneducated guesses. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">No matter how convinced you are of something, life will show you an angle you weren't expecting.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Best thing to do is exactly what you want - because whether you choose the "wise" or the "foolish" route, the net result is the same:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You get some things right. You get most things wrong. Life beats you down, and then you have a few amazing moments.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Responsibility of Having an Opinion is Expressing it Honestly - Morning Coffee #30</title>
      <link>/blog/the-responsibility-of-having-an-opinion-is-expressing-it-honestly-morning-coffee-30</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2oFf19GIZdo?controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I've always resisted the idea that you should keep your opinions to yourself when it will rock the boat or cause conflict.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I really dislike the idea of censoring my actual thoughts and feelings for the sake of some arbitrary standard of "peace".</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I just don't think we have time for that.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Whether we allow ourselves to believe it or not - our time is limited, and every moment of growth that we waste by hiding our actual opinions and thoughts is a moment we can never get back.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And worse than that - training your mind to tell little white lies (regardless of the motive) changes the way you think. Before long, NOTHING YOU SAY is true. Everything you say to everyone becomes the rose-colored (false) version of events. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I think we're afraid of not getting everything perfect every time. And we're afraid of the messiness. You can't predict everyone's opinion or their reaction to your opinion, so if everyone starts being honest, things can get really messy.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But life IS a mess. There's nothing clean or neat or predictable about it.

      <title>The Agency That SHOULD Exist - Morning Coffee #36</title>
      <link>/blog/morning-coffee-36</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OFGGPTBrjuY?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" height="480" width="854" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>
 
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So I have this vision for an agency that would solve a MAJOR problem for freelance web talent (copywriters, designers, developers, marketers, etc).</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The inspiration for this agency comes from a few different places:</p><h1 style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> 1. Hired Gun (on Netflix)</h1><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This movie is all about the studio musicians that often are the workhorses behind the popular musicians that we celebrate. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This movie tells the story of some of the greatest musicians alive who just happen to be better at literally playing second fiddle to the more popular names, and therefore we don’t know who they are.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In some instances, the “hired guns” were directly responsible for the success of a certain song, because they suggested specific changes to it or provided an iconic instrumentation for it, and yet we still don’t know who they are. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Some of them, in fact, are struggling to make a living, even though they should be listed right alongside the major artists that are making millions off of their hard work.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I immediately felt a kinship with those musicians, because I (and hundreds of others like me) have generated <em>billions</em> of dollars in revenue for others, and yet some of us struggle to make rent payments each month.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There is obviously a lot that I could unpack there, but suffice it to say, I started thinking of myself and others in my similar position as “hired guns” in the same way that these musicians are.</p><h1 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">2. Episode 293 of the #AskGaryVee Show (with Michael Ovitz)</h1>
 
   <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/UOWVtyb-pz4?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" height="480" width="854" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>
 
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">On this episode, Gary and Michael talk about how CAA (Michael’s talent agency) took Hollywood by storm by completely changing the way that studios interact with agencies.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Instead of simply representing individuals (actors, directors, etc), Michael started bringing complete projects to the studios. He’d round up a cast, the writer, the director, and the other pieces of the puzzle and presented that to the studio with a budget, and then they’d make the movie.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I might be misquoting that slightly, but that’s what I remember, and that’s what struck me.  Because of Michael and CAA, the major studios no longer had to do the legwork of putting the movie together, they just had to pay for it. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And that was better for everyone involved. Michael’s team was representing the talent, so they were more interested in preserving the artistic nature of the projects, where a studio executive might be quick to shut down an idea or theme because of budget, legal, or other restraints.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So the talent wins, because they’re represented by someone who has their best interest at heart, the studio wins, because they don’t have to waste time putting the projects together (which they’re not that good at anyway), and CAA wins, because they get to work directly with <em>everyone</em>, creating relationships and opportunities for virtually unlimited future projects.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There is so much gold in this episode, I could go on for pages and pages, but for now I’ll just say that this episode sparked the notion that there could be one central agency that negotiates complete packages for business owners, so one contract could include the campaign builder, the copywriter, the designer, and anyone else that’s necessary, and they’d all come together for that particular project.</p><h1 style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B07JGCMW2V/ref=atv_dp_pb_core?autoplay=1&amp;t=5338" target="_blank">3. Season 1 Episode 3 of The Romanoffs (Amazon Prime)</a></h1><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">First of all, this is a great show. I highly recommend it.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In this particular episode, there is an actress who is hired to play a part in a TV show, and she’s flown in for the on-location shoot. It’s immediately apparent that she is very particular, and being a popular actress, she is used to getting her way and having things just so.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">She butts heads with the director, and eventually it gets to the point where she doesn’t want to be part of the show anymore, and calls her agent.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The thing I found particularly interesting is that <em>her agent</em> accepts the task of getting her out of that predicament, something that I didn’t realize agents do. Now, I’m not sure that is actually true, and the episode actually leaves it a bit ambiguous as to whether he really would get her out of that situation should it arise, but it got me thinking.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sometimes the relationship between expert and business owner can get off track or flat out untenable. The problem is, the experts (or the talent) don’t have the time or the desire to deal with those kinds of situations. I know I’ve been in that situation enough times to know how much of an energy suck it can be, but if there was someone else who  was truly incentivized to have my best interest in mind and get me out of bad situations (or at least help with explaining what was happening), I’d be more free to do what I’m actually good at, instead of always having to switch back and forth.</p><h1 style="text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;">So - My Vision</h1><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">My vision is to create an agency that sits between the implementers and the business owners and facilitates the entire process, enabling the business owner and the talent to spend their time where they should: on the actual project.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The cool thing is that also creates opportunities to educate and empower the talent with training courses and programs, as well as standardize the rates and ratings of everyone providing the services. It’s the wild west right now, and it’s about time to establish some law and order in the industry.</p>]]></content:encoded>
      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Life as a freelance digital marketing expert (campaign builder, designer, copywriter, developer, etc) is not as lucrative as it seems.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We love to talk about our exorbitant hourly rates, but the truth is, we only charge that much because we are limited in the number of hours that we can actually bill at those rates.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There is so much time and effort that is wasted trying to find new business, and the deck is pretty much stacked against us.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I have a vision for a way to solve that problem.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>Certification (it's just a piece of paper) - Morning Coffee #32</title>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Do you have a college degree? What about an industry certification? </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Did you notice that it’s possible to get either of those without really knowing anything about the subject matter? </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Or, conversely, remember that scene from Good Will Hunting, where he tells the Harvard student that he wasted $150,000 on an education he could have gotten for $1.50 in late fees at the public library?</p><div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:44%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/jfsaMQr3GNkKk" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In truth, college educations and industry certifications are unfortunately <em>not</em> synonymous with competence or expertise. There are enough examples of people who achieved the accolades but don’t have the first clue about the subject matter,.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And there are <em>plenty</em> of people that have real-world expertise in those matters that never bothered pursuing either.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">That doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with getting a degree or certification - in fact sometimes those things are necessary to advance your goals.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But it’s important that you not consider them as anything more than what they actually are:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Pieces of paper.</p>]]></content:encoded>
      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Did you get a college degree?

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">What I’m about to share with you is the result of many, many years of life bashing me over the head trying to get me to understand this simple principle.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I am not someone who enjoys saying “No”.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I don’t like thinking (or thinking that someone else is thinking) that I’m not capable of doing something.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I say yes to <em>everything</em>, because I see every request as a challenge, and I don’t back down from challenges.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The unfortunate side effect of this is that I get spread very thin very quickly. And my lizard brain gets so focused on accepting every challenge that it forgets sometimes about some of the simpler challenges that it’s already accepted.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I don’t know if you can relate to this at all, but it’s genuinely frustrating for just about everyone involved.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;">Scratch that, it’s frustrating for everyone involved.</p></blockquote>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5c31834caa4a99548f7d8428/1546748774701/frustrated.gif" alt=""/>
  

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Not too long ago, in an extraordinarily uncommon flash of lucidity, I realized that a HUGE part of my problem is that I was treating my “work” life differently from my “home” and “personal” lives.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I realized that while I put a lot of effort into building out systems to keep track of everything I was supposed to do for my clients, I wasn’t doing the same for simple tasks or projects that myself and Sue were undertaking.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I also wasn’t really setting goals for my personal life in the same way that I was for my clients or even my own business.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And because I had these different “systems”, I was effectually multitasking between task systems (how’s that for meta?).</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">All of that would have meant basically nothing, except I remembered an article I’d read back in 2006 published by the American Psychological Association about <a href="https://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask.aspx">how multitasking is just switching back and forth between things, and it has an immense psychological cost.</a> </p><h1 style="text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>It hit me like a train.</strong></h1><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Switching back and forth between “task management” systems for the different parts of my life <em>actually had a cost!</em></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I wasn’t able to perform at optimum in any of those areas of my life because I was wasting too much energy switching back and forth between how I managed that part of my life!</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So I did what any sane, reasonable person would do in that situation: I dumped all of my ideas out on the table to try and sort them out.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I realized something right off the bat.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>There were too many things.</strong></h2><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If I was going to get anything done, I needed to trim the fat on these projects and ideas.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><em>And there was a lot of fat.</em></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The first thing I had to do was let go of many of the little “hobby” ideas that I’d kept on the back burner because “you never know”.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I just looked through all of those ideas and plans and put them in order from “I don’t want to die having never accomplished this” to “Meh”.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Things like going back to law school, starting a band, writing a novel, starting a virtual staffing agency, teaching music, and teaching Russian didn’t make the cut, because I had other things that I wanted to spend my time on more.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I realized that the things that I was most passionate about, that I really didn’t want to give up, were these (in this order):</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sue (and the bear, of course)</h2></li><li><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Muay Thai</h2></li><li><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Music</h2></li><li><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Marketing (only because it’s my only viable source of income)</h2></li></ol><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The really cool thing at this point was that the things that I was really passionate about all in different “categories” (except music and Muay Thai, which were both hobbies).</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As I was considering this list, it occurred to me that a person might really only be able to maintain 1 major “project” in each area of life. I looked at this list and it was clear - even if I let these 4 occupy 100% of my waking time, I still probably wouldn’t be able to do any of them justice.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So that made closing the door on my other ideas really easy.</p><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>Ok so what’s all this have to do with wives and mistrisses?</strong></h2><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Let me explain:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I really like metaphors, and as I was thinking about this cute little list of things that I had chosen to do, I came up with this one:</p><p style="text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>A man, at any point in his life, can have one wife, one mistress, and one vice.</strong><br><em>And I’m not talking about marriage or infidelity, this is a metaphor.</em></p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5c3192ac575d1f6be28067db/1546752717985//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<h1 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Wife</h1><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A man is loyal to his wife, he comes home to his wife, eats dinner with his wife, and works day in and day out to support his wife. His wife represents everything that is steadfast in his life. She is there for him when he needs her, and most importantly, he is committed to her enough to work on their relationship. If things aren’t great, they go to counseling. If there are problems, he talks them out with her. He wants it to work, and everything he does (well, almost everything), is to ensure that the marriage succeeds.</p>&nbsp;
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5c31931d40ec9a8d36cd22d3/1546752813737//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<h1 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Mistress</h1><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">However, the man sometimes gets restless and turns to his mistress. He doesn’t love her, but she provides a much needed (and short lived) release from the steadiness of the wife. He is not committed to his mistress. If there are issues with the mistress, he can leave and find another. The mistress is fully aware of this, and is not looking for anything more. It’s not to say that he can’t fall in love with his mistress, but then she becomes his wife and some other “strumpet” takes her place as the mistress.</p>&nbsp;
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5c31945ecd836655934388e5/1546753128703//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<h1 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Vice</h1><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In other cases, the man needs a break from women altogether. He needs something that doesn’t require any other person, and that he doesn’t have to share. His vices are for him and him alone. He doesn’t abuse them, because he understands that overindulgence will make him soft. He partakes when he needs to, and then returns to his wife.</p>&nbsp;<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">These three (wife, mistress, vice) occupy all of the man’s time and energy, but the balance of the three keeps him satisfied, refreshed, and motivated to do what he needs to do. He <em>needs</em> all three to maintain that balance.</p><p style="text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>He works hardest on his relationship with his wife, because it drives his passion.</strong></p><p style="text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>He toys with his mistress, because that is what “tickles his fancy”.&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>He indulges in his vice, but sparingly so as to not spoil it.</strong></p><hr /><h2 style="text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;"><em>Now we do the wrap-up</em></h2>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5c31903c032be4fbaf29c53c/1546752068128/bow.gif" alt=""/>
  

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I believe that each of us can realistically handle 3 “projects” at a time. The first (the wife) is the singular project that gives us purpose and provides meaning for life.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The second (the mistress) is whatever pet project we are entertaining at the time, whether it be a new service, a side gig, a hobby, or an actual mistress.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The third (the vice) is the project that we do just for ourselves. It could be blogging, writing poetry, playing poker, building a cigar collection, or becoming a sommelier. Sometimes a hobby can start as a vice, then become a mistress, and eventually you put a ring on it and it becomes your main focus.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So consider this for your life:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">What represents “The Wife” for you? “The Mistress”? “The Vice”?</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Let me know in the comments below:</p>&nbsp;]]></content:encoded>
      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">People (myself included most of all) often make the mistake of thinking that they are capable of handling anything that comes their way.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The truth is, a person can really only juggle three things at once:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Wife, The Mistress, and The Vice.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>Facebook Ads on a Fixed Budget - Tech Tips #1</title>
      <link>/blog/facebook-ads-on-a-fixed-budget-tech-tips-1</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5c3394c788251b550e5adf51/1546884330560//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

&nbsp;<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If you’re running Facebook ads, you probably don’t have an unlimited budget. (side note - if you <em>do</em> have an unlimited budget, my hat goes off to you. also, you should give me some)</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The problem with being on a limited budget is keeping track of how much you’re spending across the various campaigns that you’re running, not to mention the posts that you’re boosting.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">However, there’s a little hack you can use to make sure that no matter what you do, your monthly ad spend will always be the same.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Here’s how you do it:</p><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>1. Consolidate Your Campaigns</strong></h2><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The first thing you need to do is create 3-5 campaigns, organized by preferred outcome.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You may end up with more or less campaigns depending on whether you release video content. You’ll want to have a campaign for each type of content. So if you have videos, you’ll want a campaign optimized for video views. If you have blog content, you’ll want a campaign optimized for content views (viewContent). If you have content that is intended to get someone to take some action outside Facebook, you’ll want a campaign optimized for conversions. So, assuming you release videos on a regular basis, these are the campaigns you’d have:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Awareness (optimized for brand awareness)</p></li><li><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Video Engagement (optimized for video views) </p></li><li><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Content Engagement (optimized for viewContent)</p></li><li><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Action (optimized for conversions)</p></li></ol><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>2. Campaign Budget Optimization</strong></h2><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The next thing you need to do is set all of your campaigns to optimize the spend at the campaign level:</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You can set each campaign to a limited budget of as low as $2/day (around $65/mo). That would total out to $8/day across all 4 of the campaigns (or $260/mo).&nbsp;</p><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">3. Configure the Campaigns for Cold and Warm Audience Targeting</h2><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Within each of the above campaigns, set up ad sets to distinguish between target groups. I normally have 3 ad sets per campaign:</p>

<ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Warm audience rollup - basically anyone that has engaged in any way (watched video, clicked to website, liked/commented/shared post, etc)</p></li><li><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Cold lookalike rollup - all of your lookalike audiences combined.</p></li><li><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Cold interest rollup - targeting based on interest only (no custom audiences).</p></li></ol><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space: pre-wrap;"></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I also like to make the audiences mutually exclusive, so I’ll exclude my lookalike audiences from the Warm and Interest rollups, the Warm Audience from the Cold Rollups, etc.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And now for the secret sauce.</p><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">4. Add New Content To Existing Campaigns</h2><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Now, when you release new content, instead of boosting the post individually, simply add it to the existing campaign based on the type of content and who should see it.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So if you release a new video intended for your followers, here’s what you do:</p>

<ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Navigate to the Video Engagement campaign</p></li><li><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Select the Warm Audience Rollup ad set</p></li><li><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Click “Create” to create a new ad</p></li><li><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Select “Use Existing Post”</p></li><li><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Select your post</p></li><li><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Publish</p></li></ol><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space: pre-wrap;"></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The really cool thing is that it doesn’t matter where the post was originally released (Facebook/Instagram), because it can be promoted on both platforms at the same time (assuming the video isn’t longer than 1 minute).</p><h1 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The wrap-up</h1><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Setting up your campaigns this way will help you organize your content by use, but more importantly it helps you keep your ad spend predictable. Instead of creating a new campaign for every post, you’re simply using the campaigns that already exist, and adding the content to those.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">On a regular basis, it’s a good idea to go back through and disable the content that isn’t performing as well, so that you can make way for fresh content.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Thoughts, feedback, questions?

      <title>Just do it</title>
      <link>/blog/21</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brad was very much into sports, which I think has a lot to do with his attitude about work. In sports, there's not a whole lot of actual thinking that you do. Obviously you have to think about what you're doing, but philosophizing on the way the basketball net represents life isn't going to help you make baskets. I think that's why I wasn't ever that good at basketball. I just over-thought everything. It was especially bad with baseball. You can't hit home runs by thinking too much. You think too much, and you'll miss the pitch every time. Anyway, back to Brad. Being so into sports, Brad was quite obsessed with Nike. I remember one time we were on vacation and Brad really wanted to go to the mall because they had a huge Nike store there. He loved Nike. Interestingly enough, the slogan, "Just do it" stuck with him I think, and kind of became his motto for life. Just do it. When I finally figured this one out, I looked back and realized how much time I'd wasted trying to get out of things. I wasted more time and energy avoiding responsibility than it would have taken to just do whatever it was that I was supposed to do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take making the bed for example. My whole life, I would try to do make my bed as quickly as possible and expend the least amount of energy possible. Or doing the dishes; I would make up all kinds of excuses, and just wander around until someone else did the dishes and then I'd come waltzing in at the end to make it look like I'd helped. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A huge part of this lesson is coming to the realization that you are not entitled to anything. So often we grow up with the notion that we are entitled to the good things attached to good actions, and so if there is no benefit for us, we don't do it. Welcome to the real world, people. Entitlement is as bogus a principle as any, and so many of us refuse to do the simple things in life because we don't think they will bring us the satisfaction we deserve. Once you realize that you really aren't entitled to anything, you realize that the real reason for doing things is because you are responsible for them. I do the dishes because they are my dishes, not because it’s my turn to do them or because I think I'll get something from doing them. I make the bed because it's my bed and I am responsible for it. I just do it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I really wish I had understood this principle in high school. Back then I thought I owned the world, and I figured I could do anything that I wanted. I didn't study in high school because I didn't think that I needed to. I finished high school with a fairly good GPA, and I studied for 1 test the entire time. I had decided that I didn't need to study because I could still do well without studying. It was just a waste of time for me to study, or so I thought. If I had just studied, then I would have saved myself the two semesters of college that I totally bombed because I didn't really know how to study. If only I had just done it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I could go into all kinds of examples about this principle, but I think I've made myself clear. I think in general, if you find yourself not wanting to do something that you know full well is your responsibility, and you hear yourself saying things like, "but I don't need to do that," or, "but that's boring," or anything like that, JUST DO IT! </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>We like because, but we love even though</title>
      <link>/blog/33</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many times I’ve heard in movies or from friends or acquaintances phrases such as, “I just don’t love him/her anymore because of this thing he did,” or “I put up with his habits when we first got married but I just can’t stand them anymore.” The general theme is that one cannot love another unless the other is doing everything right all the time. So much of how much one person loves another is tangled up in what the other person does. Let me give a few examples to show how this line of thinking and feeling is absolutely bogus and does not work in real life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Example #1</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When I was serving a Mormon mission in Ukraine, part of my responsibility as a missionary was to love the people. Without an unconditional and real love for the people, I would have been ineffective and unhappy as a missionary. (I realize that this example may strike some as not applicable, but the point is that I needed to love them, and it could have been for any reason.) At first I found it difficult to love the people because as a general rule everyone drinks and smokes, and much of the time they do both at the same time. Not only this, but the culture there is intensely promiscuous, and so I had to struggle a lot with very forward women who sometimes could not see past the fact that I was an American boy with an American passport that somehow could get them to America if they were to impress me in a sexual way. These and many other factors made it nearly impossible for me to really love them, because they were doing so many terrible things all of the time, or so I thought.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As I matured in the mission and grew into the work more, I came to realize that I was no longer disturbed by the constant drinking and smoking, and I found creative ways to avoid awkward situations with the women. The constant distaste that I had for them began to wane, and I realized that the more I worked to serve them, the more I grew to love them. I was out on the streets or knocking on doors or chatting with people all of the time, and before too long, I realized that I loved every person that I saw or met. To this day, I have a deep love for the Ukrainian people. I have come to see a deep strain of very admirable and loveable characteristics that are pretty much intrinsic in all Ukrainians. There are still things about Ukraine that I don’t and will never miss, but the people of Ukraine I will always miss.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It turns out one way to really love people is to forget what they are doing and focus on what you are doing. I would submit that at least 80% of the time, if you find yourself blaming someone else for your lack of love for them; it is mostly your fault. Let me say that again. If you are blaming someone else for the fact that you don’t love them anymore, it is more than likely that it’s your fault.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Example #2</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before my wife and I were married, we had some couple friends that were at about the same stage of dating as we were. It happened to be the case, however, that many of the relationship difficulties that every couple must go through were hitting us about two weeks before it would hit them. Now, this couple will know who they are when they read this, so I hope they don’t mind me using this story, but it applies universally I think. About once every couple of weeks, the guy in this other relationship would come stay the night at my place and the girl with Naomi at her place. In almost every instance, they both had some fairly serious frustrations with the other, and so it was good for them to have some time away with a slightly more experienced couple (and by that I reiterate, about two weeks more experienced) with whom they could discuss what had happened. I remember quite clearly that almost every time, the frustrations of each individual were with something that the other had done or was doing, and neither of them were able to see past that. The amazing part for me was that I could see in both of their faces how much they actually loved each other, regardless of what was actually going on in the relationship. When they talked about breaking up for a little while, I could see on both of their faces how little they really wanted that. When they would talk about how it might not work out and they might have gone their separate ways, I could see both of their hearts breaking, and one of them even started crying when it was brought up. The point here is that with their eyes and their opinions, they were overlooking what their hearts knew very strongly. They saw what seemed to them to be unsavory qualities and bad habits, and in their opinions, that seemed to make the decision for them. But all along it was written all over them how much they deeply loved each other. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once they realized for themselves how much they really loved each other, and saw past the little irksome habits, they knew that they only wanted to be with each other, and they were married a few months later. They still have tiffs and little skirmishes, but they realize now, at least to some extent, that love is not about what the other person does, it’s about how you feel when you are doing everything you can for the other person. Love isn’t about expecting affection; it’s about learning to work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Example #3</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My wife and I have been married for almost nine months now, and if there is one thing that I have learned, it’s that she really must love me, because much of the time she really doesn’t like me. I can be quite hard-headed sometimes, and sometimes I say and do things that you just shouldn’t say or do, ever. The worst part is I’m also a very proud person, and tend to defend myself to the very end. For those of you more experienced husbands, you understand the folly in that, and for you less experienced husbands, shoot for humility early on. My wife, however upset and frustrated she is with me at any particular time, which on average is a little to mildly upset, has never even hinted at leaving or threatened me in any way. She just goes about her business until I wisen up, which I do sometimes, and apologize to her. Now, I know I’m not perfect, and I know that my imperfections are the bane of my wife’s existence, but she is constantly looking past those stupid things that I do and trying to make things better because she knows the difference between liking and loving. I can attest to the fact that my wife does not always like me. Sometimes she does, but I’m a bit of an egg-head and so it’s not surprising that she would find occasion to “fall out of like” with me. However, she has never even hinted that she was falling out of love with me. For that I am always grateful, because I know that I love her more than anything, and if she was to give up on me, I’d be up a creek.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I use these particular examples for a couple of reasons. First, the main point here at first seems to be that you have to look past someone’s faults in order to really love them. This is absolutely true. If you can learn to look past peoples faults, you will find your capacity to love increases a hundred-fold.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My real point, however, comes from a quote that I heard a while back. I don’t remember who said it, but I think regardless of its origin, it applies. “You know you’re really in love with someone if you have encountered their faults and you still want to spend the rest of your life with them.” I would take that a step further and say that if you know someone’s faults and you want to be with them on the condition that you are able to change some of their faults, give it up now. Such relationships are doomed from the beginning. You must know their faults and be perfectly willing to be with them forever even if they only change a little bit or in some cases not at all. Obviously if their faults are going to lead to really bad a place, that’s a different story, but if someone has faults that are going to lead them there, get out of the relationship! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My conclusion is this. First, in general, learn to look past people’s faults and see them for who they really are, not a bundle of mistakes, but a human being no better or worse than you are. Second, when looking for someone to spend your life with, be sure that you are comfortable with everything about them. Do not expect to change them, because you will not be able to! Be wise, however, and understand the difference between a real deal-breaker and a stupid pet peeve. Third, once in a marriage relationship, never lose sight of the fact that you love the person you are with. Every single married couple on that has ever been, with the possible exception of one (but we don’t know enough about that to say anything) has gotten into fights over dumb little habits that one or the other has. Don’t think that it’s the end of the world or your marriage because of a fight. Learn that you can still love someone and not like them at that particular time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Love is not something that comes and goes like the fleeting wind. That is like. We like people because they do things that we enjoy. We love people even though they do things we don’t like. Know the difference.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>There’s nothing quite like family</title>
      <link>/blog/61</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So I just got back from what I'm going to refer to as the first ever Stan &amp; Susan Martineau Family Reunion. It was a little bit weird for me, since at every other family reunion that I've been to I've been one to the grandkids, or great-grandkids. At this one, I was one of the uncles, one of the second generation, not the third or fourth. The other weird thing was that it wasn't so much a reunion as much as it was a retreat, although since I came from Utah, it was kind of a reunion. Anyway, let me get to the point.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Tuesday of last week, my parents came back to the states after a 3 year 'term' in Puerto Rico, where Dad served as the president of one of the missions there. Needless to say, it is very nice to have parents again. I've essentially been without a mother and father for the past 5 years almost, since I had been in Ukraine for a while before they left. I'm going to be honest, life without parents is no good. I've had a lot of substitutes for parents, like brothers and sisters, my wife, and my in-laws, but nobody can really hold a candle to mom and dad. I can't really express accurately in words (or any other way for that matter) how amazing it is to know that they can be mom and dad again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another reason why it is so nice to have mom and dad back is that all of us kids can be the children again. While mom and dad were gone, all of us had to sort of step it up and be more 'responsible' because mom and dad weren't there to be the 'responsible' ones. I don't know if I can really describe it, but it seemed like as soon as they got home the brothers started wrestling again, and the sisters started acting like sisters and not co-chairs of the Martineau Committee. It just seems more like the family that it used to be back before I left for Ukraine 5 years ago. I've missed that a lot. It's nice to have it back.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now I'm sitting on my in-laws' couch thinking back on the trip and realizing that I really wish that it had never needed to end. Mom and dad just got back, and now I have to go back home to Utah and miss out on all the Sunday get-togethers and the random weekday lunch trips to Gecko Grill with everyone. Especially knowing that mom and dad are planning to serve another mission at the end of this year, it just makes leaving right now that much harder.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I love my family, because that is the only place, the only organization or group, where things don't really change. My place in the family is always the same, and I never have to worry about trying to be anything but myself. I don't have to be smart or athletic, I don't have to have the best ideas or do the smartest things, I don't have to be the best at anything, because my family makes it abundantly clear that they love me just the way that I am, and will keep loving me no matter what. That is security that you just can't find very often these days.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I'm on the verge of going back to real life, and I really don't want to take the plunge. I've just had the best 4 days since I left for Ukraine 5 years ago. I really don't like for things like this to have to end. Why is it that they always do</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The very next day</title>
      <link>/blog/79</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wednesday was not a good day. Thursday didn't start out too well either. Then something amazing happened:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But first, as always, back story.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">About a month ago, I went to a meeting that the Russian department put on to talk about their study abroad/internship program in Moscow. I'll be honest, I mostly went for the donuts, but during the course of the meeting, I was suddenly convinced that I needed to go to Moscow and do this internship. Went home and talked to the wife about it, and then was assisted in realizing that we absolutely could not afford for me to go. And we really couldn't.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fast forward to about Monday of this week. I had finally committed myself to the idea that I'd focus on school and law, and let Russian be a hobby for the rest of my life. I was ok with that, too. I was settling into the new direction that I'd decided to take my life, and it actually felt nice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now fast forward to Thursday (starts out crappy, like Wednesday was). It's the middle of the day, I'm just sitting somewhere trying to figure life out (first mistake) and I get a call from one of my Russian professors. He tells me he has a proposition for me. He says that they usually take a grad student to be the assistant program director for the study abroad/internship program. That position is a lot like a fellowship, and the person team teaches with the professor, teaching the 100-level students that go. Most of those students are the spouses of the other students that go; most of whom already speak Russian. Because the assistant program director helps teach, they are paid by stipend, and their program costs are covered by that stipend, as is airfare. Then he tells me something that makes me almost start crying immediately:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He told me then that the grad student that was set to go had to back out unexpectedly. Then he said that he recommended to the department that I take the place of the grad student as the assistant director, and that another two of the Russian professors seconded the proposition and they agreed to offer me the position. Now, I realize that there seems to be little reason to get emotional about that, especially for me, a person who rarely, if ever, gets emotional. But this was special to me. After spending weeks thinking that nobody cared about me and that nobody thought I was good for anything, here are my professors recommending me to take the place of a graduate student. I can think of at least 5 other students in the Russian program who are much better Russian speakers and writers. I am definitely not the most qualified for the position, but for some reason these professors decided to recommend me. After the week that I'd been having, I think you can understand me getting a little emotional. It meant a lot to me that somewhere, not under my control, someone thought of me in that way, and spoke highly of me. I didn't ask for anything like this, and yet it happened.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I don't know if I can adequately describe the feeling. It was a good one; I guess that's all that matters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I don't know if I'll actually be able to go. I'd love to, of course, but there are things with graduation that I have to figure out. Apparently BYU gets picky about changing things once you've hit 90 credits, so I have to go talk to an advisor and make sure that I could still graduate if I were to go. But regardless of whether I go, just knowing that those men though highly enough of me to recommend that I take the place of a graduate student meant the world to me, and pulled me the rest of the way out of my slump. (Yes, those of you that sent me messages regarding Wednesdays post got me a little of the way out of it. Thanks) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Life isn't all perfect and peachy now, but I sure feel a lot better.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Is it interesting to anyone else that this all happened the day after I posted my apology?</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Is God subject to Morality?</title>
      <link>/blog/91</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a paper I wrote for a philosophy class:
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The relationship between deity and morality poses interesting questions. Which of the two influences the other? Does either other exist only because of the other? Or do they exist entirely separate from each other? I will focus on answering these questions. In particular, I will show three things: First, based on the contradictory results of the alternative options, deity must determine mortal morality. Second, some higher code must influence deity in the determination of morality. Third, this theory still applies even if deity does not exist. Using these three considerations, I will show that although there must be some moral code to which deity is subject, deity is the sole source of all moral law to which we mortals are subject; morality as we are subject to it is the result of divine command.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I will use the example of murder to show that morality is established by deity. In essence, I will show that, no matter the relationship between morality and deity, murder is only wrong because deity has decreed it so. First, I will consider the three options regarding the relationship between deity and morality: (1) morality is under complete direction of deity, (2) deity is subject to a higher moral code, and (3) morality and deity are separate from each other. Next, assuming each of these options independently, I will show that murder, which is all but universally accepted as morally wrong, is only so because of the prescription of deity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first option is that all morality is under the complete direction of deity. In other words, that which is right or wrong is only so because of divine command. The result of this is that morality is entirely arbitrary, because regardless of the fact that deity did make right and wrong what they are, it <i>could</i> have been otherwise. It could be argued that deity could have reasons for giving particular commands. However, if <i>all</i> morality is under the direction of deity, then the only reasons which can influence deity in the determination of morality are purely rational, with no moral considerations whatsoever. Otherwise, there would be some moral principle or code which influences deity, which the initial premise shows cannot be the case. It is clear that under this option, murder is only wrong because deity so commanded it. If morality is completely subject to the direction of deity, then any act which is wrong is only so because of deific direction. Therefore, if morality is entirely subject to deity, then it must follow that the immorality of murder is determined by deity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The second option is that morality is higher than deity, and so deity is entirely subject to it. If this is the case, it would follow that it is outside the power of deity to break that moral code in any way. Any deific action contrary to any instance of that higher moral code, including deific sanction of the act, would therefore be impossible. If it were possible, in the literal sense, for deity to contradict, directly or indirectly, a higher moral code, then one of two options must hold; (1) either the higher moral code is not actually binding on deity, in which case we are actually still operating under the first option, or (2) deity would have to be capable of ceasing to be deity. I will not consider the first option as I have already done so. The second option requires further explanation. I will explain this concept, drawing on Thomas Nagel’s reasoning in the eighth chapter of his book, <i>The Possibility of Altruism.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If deity were capable of ceasing to be deity, then we would have to accept that the present deity (that which exists as I am writing these words) is somehow dissociated from the future deity (that which exists as the reader is reading these words). This brings with it unfortunate and contradictory results, the first of which is a requirement that deity is subject to time in the same way that we are, which is widely accepted to be false. The accepted notion that deity operates outside of time requires that deity not be capable of relinquishing those deific qualities and ceasing to be deity. If deity exists outside time, then every dated interpretation thereof would have to reflect the same exact being or entity, because regardless of the point in time at which the interpretation is made, the reference is made to the same metaphysical entity. Therefore, it cannot be the case that deity is deific at one point in time, and at another point in time, loses its divinity. Otherwise, we would be able to assert two equally true, yet contradictory, statements about the same entity. In other words, it would be possible to say of the same entity that it is at the same time deity and not deity. Therefore, if there is a higher moral code, then at the risk of ceasing to be deity and creating these contradictory results, deity would be incapable of acting in contradiction of that code. (57-76)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I will now assume that murder is an instance of that higher moral code. If murder is a part of the higher code, then deity would be incapable of murder or the sanction of murder. However, deity has not only sanctioned murder, but commanded it. Nephi states very clearly, “I was constrained by the Spirit that I should kill Laban” (<i>The Book of Mormon </i>1 Nep. 4:10). Nephi doubted this command, and was hesitant to comply, but “the Spirit said unto me again: Slay him” (1 Nep. 4:12). Nephi then murdered Laban. So in this case deity <i>was</i> able to act in contradiction to the higher moral code that murder is wrong. Therefore, by application of modus tollens, murder cannot be part of the higher moral code to which deity is subject. This does not prove that deity is not subject to <i>any</i> sort of code, however. This simply shows that murder cannot be part of the code to which deity is subject, if there is one. Therefore, if murder is not part of a higher code, then the wrongness of murder has to come directly from deity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One could raise the objection that there could be other instances of the same higher moral code which negate the wrongness of murder in this instance. In other words, one could argue that there are exceptions to every rule. However, it does not seem reasonable to me<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that the higher moral code, to which even deity is subject, would be ridden with exceptions in this way. If that were the case, then there would have to be some way of determining which exceptions are considered valid for each of the moral laws, which seems to presuppose one of two things: (1) that there is an even higher entity which directed deity to direct Nephi to kill Laban in this instance, or (2) that the higher moral code is written down somewhere with each exception spelled out. The second option presupposes the first, and is only included to illustrate the absurdity of assuming that the higher moral code would or even could include exceptions. Exceptions to any rule presuppose an authority to which one can appeal for direction in the application of those exceptions. Allowing for this kind of authority which is higher than deity entails an infinite regress of higher authority, and therefore an infinite regress of deity. Incidentally, an infinite regress of deity is simply a more convoluted way to say, “Deity came first, so morality came second.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The third option is that deity and morality do not influence each other. In other words, their respective influences over us come from altogether separate sources, and the influence of each does not reach far enough to affect the other. To illustrate, imagine two bank tellers whose booths are separated by a thick, soundproof wall. They are both able to communicate with you, the customer, but not with each other. They each influence you, but that influence comes separately, and neither is influenced by the other. Now, let us assume that murder is against the moral code, which we will place into the first booth. Into the second booth, we place deity. Now we will examine the implications of this option. This seems to resolve the problem of deity contradicting the higher moral code, because the moral code itself is outside the influence of deity. However, upon closer examination, we find this not to be the case. Let us examine the case of Nephi under this option. We can explain Nephi’s initial hesitation to carry out the command, as he had, in effect, the moral code telling him that murder is wrong from the first teller booth. Then, however, deity confirms the instruction, and Nephi kills Laban. So even in this instance, where it seems as though deity has no obligation to conform to any moral code, it is yet able to override the dictates of the moral code. Therefore, the moral code only exists insofar as deity does not command otherwise, or to put it differently, the moral code is only applicable until deity sees the need for a contradiction of that code. This can only be the case if, as in the first option, morality is under the complete direction of deity. In any event, under this option, the wrongness of murder lies at the discretion of deity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let us consider the implications of what has been shown thus far. First, either murder is wrong because deity so dictated or murder is wrong because a higher moral code so dictated. Second, even if deity is constrained by morality, murder cannot be a part of that morality by which deity is constrained. We are left with only one option: murder is wrong only because deity has so dictated. These preliminary findings bring with them a particularly implication that is<i> prima facia </i>disturbing. I will now focus my attention on resolving this concern.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having shown that deity determines morality, we are left to deal with the accompanying concept of the arbitrariness of morality. This concept, as mentioned above, is quite disturbing in that it allows for a possible world in which deity determined morality to be opposite what it is in our world. This possibility is impossible to avoid in any option which asserts that deity is in complete control of morality. In order to rectify this seemingly irresolvable problem, we must consider two options: (1) morality is in fact arbitrary, or (2) there is <i>some</i> higher code which binds deity. It is important not to confuse the second option here with the second option considered above in regard to the relationship between deity and morality. In this instance, the higher code is not a set of morals which deity must uphold. Instead, it is a set of meta-morals or rules governing the creation of morals which sets the boundaries within which deity is free to determine the moral code of us mortals. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first option is that morality is arbitrary. In other words, it is conceivable that deity, in some possible world, decided that rape, pillage, and cruel murder of children are considered <i>right</i>, and giving to the poor, saying kind words, and opening doors for women are considered <i>wrong</i>. This idea is understandably unsettling, as it undermines the entire idea of good and bad. If morality is entirely arbitrary in this sense, then one has much less motivation to act in accordance with the “good” which is provided. This is especially true if it turns out that deity does not actually exist. Instead of continuing to entertain this possibility, I will consider the second option.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The second option is that there is some higher code to which deity is subject. Again, this is not to be confused with the option already entertained that morality is higher than, and so directs, deity. The higher code to which I will now refer consists of a set of meta-morals which direct deity in the creation of morality. This code simply sets the boundaries in which deity is free to implement whatever moral laws are required. I assert that this code consists of two simple meta-morals: (1) good is an eternal concept which predates deity and (2) that which is to be considered right, or any consequence thereof must not contradict good. This concept resolves the issue of arbitrariness, because it dictates clearly that there are certain things which <i>cannot </i>be right, and therefore <i>must</i> be wrong. So where earlier we had to accept that in some possible world, deity could have decided that rape was right and kindness was wrong, we can now rest assured that a universal good does in fact exist. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This option resolves the arbitrariness problem, and also helps to explain the apparent discrepancy that I discussed in the first part of this paper. Although murder is only wrong because deity so commanded, the consequence of allowing murder as a permissible action would lead to a state of affairs in direct contradiction with the good, and so deity is constrained to proscribe murder in a general sense. However, because the proscription of murder is a law created by deity, deity is not universally constrained to uphold that law. This is especially true in instances where to not contradict that law would lead to consequences which <i>would</i> contradict the good. This turns out to be necessary, because it is the only way to resolve the contradiction of the “teological suspension of the ethical” (Kierkegaard), a concept which does not appear convincing in any way. If deity is constrained only to uphold the good, then it is well within the power and ability of deity to create general moral laws and break those same moral laws in individual instances. Therefore, the only viable option here is that there is some higher code to which deity is subject, and that code is simply to uphold the good.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have shown that there must be some code to which deity is subject, lest there be unfavorable and contradictory ramifications. I have not shown that morality predates and therefore controls deity. There is a difference between the code to which deity is subject and the code to which deity subjects us. Deity is restricted only by the necessity that good be upheld. All other moral considerations are given to us by deity. This is the only viable explanation of the fact that deity can (and has) broken (and allowed to be broken) certain of those commands, such as the commandment not to kill. Hence, deity is compelled to uphold good, and therefore created a system of mortal morality that would best accomplish the goal of upholding good.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So why do we not worship this form of good instead of deity? In fact, many people do worship good in some form or another. However, these people fall into a similar category as those who believe in natural law theories and so in some instances break civil laws in order to not break what they call natural or eternal laws. These people feel that they are not subject to the laws given to them because they are connected to a “higher” law which supersedes the earthly law given to them. To “go over the head” of one’s immediate legal authority in this way is dangerous in that it undermines the authority of people to make and enforce their own laws. In addition, not every person has the same connection or interpretation of deity; if every person was accountable only to natural law, there would be no consistent system of laws, and therefore there would be no rule of law. The fundamental problem with this attitude, however, is that it is completely impractical. One can disregard the laws of one’s country in favor of natural law and still be imprisoned for breaking those laws. In such cases, there is no viable defense that can be of practical use; therefore, this attitude removes the personally perceived responsibility to uphold the laws of the land without removing one’s subjection to those laws. “Going over the head” of deity to worship that to which even deity is subject (good) results in a similar impracticality. While one could cite the higher law as reason for disobeying the dictates of deity, one would yet be subject to those laws to which one is subjected by deity. Therefore one cannot appeal to a higher authority than deity without fully appeasing the demands of deity. A problem which is even more basic than the impracticality of such attitudes is the incapacity of mortals to comprehend the intricacies and nuances of the application of good in real life. Our perspective is fundamentally flawed in that it is subject to our own experience, which is fundamentally limited by those experiences which we have not yet experienced. Deity is not limited in this way, and so our ability to understand and act in accordance with good is directly connected with our compliance with the direction of deity. Put simply, deity is in a position to direct our actions in accordance with good in a way of which we are not capable, and so we are necessarily dependant on deity to keep us in accordance with good.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One particularly formidable objection to what I have shown thus far is a popular objection when discussing divinity in any form: what if deity does not exist? It would seem that removing deity from the discussion in this way makes my argument all but obsolete and useless. If deity does not exist, then my initial premises have no grounding, and my entire argument falls apart. However, those who raise such an objection fail to take a crucial fact into consideration. In order to remove deity from the discussion, one would have to completely eradicate all mention of deity from all of written history. This is because even if there is no deity, the <i>concept</i> of deity which has existed at least since the beginning of written history has provided mankind with a moral code. As I will now show, there is no way to comprehensively show that there is some other source of our morality other than this concept of deity, and morality as we know it is completely derived from deity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since the beginning of written history, or more precisely since the first recorded human experience, deity has played a very large role in human life. In every culture, this is clearly visible. The Judeo-Christian concept of deity dates back to the first verse of the Bible, written by Moses, “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth” (<i>The Holy Bible</i>, Genesis 1:1). The Greek polytheistic concept of deity is given by Homer in the beginning of the first book of <i>The Odyssey</i>, where he quickly introduces many gods (Homer). Other cultures have historical evidence of similar concepts of deity. All of these references to deity predate any recorded instance of atheism, which does not appear in history until the fifth or sixth centuries B.C., much later than these concepts of deity (Cline). Therefore, historically, deity predates atheism. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If deity, or at least a concept of deity, predates atheism, then it follows that the implications of deific existence predate the contrary considerations of atheism, in other words, deific law has influenced mankind for much longer than any other rational or ethical considerations. Today, the ethical philosophers debate over where morality comes from and where it finds its origins, but they all do so without considering the fact that the oldest form of morality in the world is this: obey God or suffer the consequences. Because deity has always advocated that people do good things, to one extent or another, it is not difficult to see that all of our present moral considerations find their primal derivation from a primitive concept of deity which predates all other ideas or concepts. In other words, all of humankind has based morality on that same primitive concept of deity which existed in the beginning. Therefore, to attempt to attribute morality to some other cognitive or emotional process denies the influence of thousands of years of written history. The fact of the matter is this: each of us learned right and wrong from our families and friends; society. Each of those people, in turn, learned right and wrong from society as it was when they were young, and so on. At some point, this retraction into history will end with a group of people learning right and wrong from someone who claimed that right and wrong are divine commands, and that disobeying them results in eternal punishment. Morality, as we know it, is based on a concept of deity which goes back much too far to simply remove from the discussion.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because this concept of deity dates back to the beginning of written history, the ontological existence of deity is not really that important. In the same way that Santa Claus can influence billions of people every year to act a certain way regardless of <i>his</i> ontological existence, deity can influence morality regardless of the related ontology because the <i>concept</i> of deity bears that burden. All that is necessary for a person to be influenced by something is for that person to <i>think</i> that the something will affect her in some way, regardless of whether or not it will. Therefore, even if deity does not exist, the simple historical fact that a concept of deity does and has existed from the beginning of written history can accommodate for that fact (that deity does not exist) and still be the source of morality in our world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have considered the possible explanations for deific sanction of immoral action, and come to the conclusion that the only possible option is that deity determines moral law, for otherwise deity would be incapable of allowing immoral acts. I have also considered the possibilities associated with this initial conclusion, and concluded that even though deity decides the morality to which we are subject, there still has to be some code to which even deity is subject, lest morality be entirely arbitrary. I have also considered the objection that deity does not exist, and I have shown that even if deity does not exist, the historically accepted concept of deity can, independent of the existence of an existing deific entity, still be the source of all morality to which we are subject. These considerations result in only one conclusion. Deity is the sole source of all moral law to which we mortals are subject; morality as we are subject to it is the result of divine command.</span></p>

      <title>The Other Shoe Always Drops</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/10/1/the-other-shoe-always-drops</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This is the first politically-charged post I’ve made in a very, <em>very</em> long time. So it’s probably going to be terrible and you should leave now before I rot your mind with my ignorance and naiveté.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ok, now that we’ve gotten that out of the way….</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There is something deeply disturbing about this Brett Kavanaugh situation. And it’s  not just the fact that he’s bringing shame on the his name (which, although incorrectly spelled, he shares with yours truly).</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It’s not just the prep school entitled misogyny that we perpetuate with our constant rug-sweeping. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It’s not how many people I personally know that are engaged in the aforementioned rug-sweeping, quoting Ford’s hazy recollection and the “convenient” timing of the accusations - implying malicious, politically-fueled intent.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It’s not the widespread mockery being made of <em>a sitting justice</em> because of an adolescent predilection for drink, and what many consider his overly emotional reaction to the allegations.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It’s not the ridiculously opportunistic politicians that are using this situation as a platform to spew hysterics in the hope of garnishing further support.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It’s not even the overt hypocrisy being displayed by all sides of the situation.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">What disturbs me most is how simple this is, and how we’re all missing the point:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><em>Regardless of intent</em>, all actions have consequences. Full stop.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><em>Regardless of education</em>, all actions have consequences. Full stop.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><em>Regardless of understanding,</em> all actions have consequences. Full stop.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><em>Regardless of timing,</em> all actions have consequences. Full stop.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">(yes, I realize the 4 full stops are both redundant and improperly used. sue me)</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Brett made a mistake back in college and it’s coming back to haunt him now. End of story.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The details of the mistake, contrary to popular opinion on <em>both</em> sides, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are completely irrelevant.</span></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Let me use a metaphor to explain my point:</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In high school, we all learned about compound interest, and how if we saved $200 per month from the time we were 20 until we were 65, we’d have $67 trillion in the bank (my memory might be a little hazy on the details).</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I understand that concept as clearly now as I did then, but I made a simple mistake. I spent that $200 each month instead of saving it. So my bank account is just a tad shy of the projected figure (by approximately $67 trillion).</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Now, I could complain that I had a lot of circumstances that caused me to spend the money instead of saving it. I could explain that I needed that money for food, rent, gas, etc., but how much of that $67 trillion am I <em>entitled</em> to?</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Zero. $0. None. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And you know what, all those reasons and excuses and rationalizations don’t make an ounce of difference when it comes to the question of my <em>right</em> to have that $67 trillion.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Because the plain truth is I made a mistake, and now I’m paying for it (literally). I can cry about it until the cows come home (or go away, depending on your preferences), but it doesn’t change the outcome.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In a similar way, let’s say I acquire a credit card with a fairly high credit limit. Let’s also say I’m not very good at budgeting, so I rack up a large amount of debt on that credit card, always with the full intention of paying it back, and always with the assumption that because the monthly payments are well within my income range, it will be fine.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Let’s say that after having accumulated all of this debt, I suddenly find myself with a vastly smaller income. I start missing payments, and the credit card company terminates my account. So now I just have a massive credit card bill, no income, and no way of using that additional credit to supplement my lack of cash.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Now I’m left with all the stuff I bought, no money, and no real way to pay it off. I start to get phone calls from debt collectors, collections notices, and the like.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I wasn’t using the purchasing power of that credit card for anything nefarious, on the contrary, it was used primarily on items to help others. I had the income to support the payments when I made the purchases. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">What I failed to do was consider a future where the dynamic has shifted and I’m no longer in the same position. I made a mistake in a moment of short-sightedness, but my short-sightedness does not get me “off the hook” for the debt. Not in any way.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It’s the same with Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It doesn’t matter how much good he’s done since college. It really doesn’t matter whether he thought that she was “asking for it” or if she <em>actually was</em> asking for it. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The real problem is that we are so against people being held responsible for their actions, regardless of intent. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Brett should have been thinking about the future potential that he could sit on the Supreme Court when he was deciding on that extra drink or fooling around with the inebriated.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If I have to be held responsible for my choice to not save that money each month or to spend too much on a credit card, Brett Kavanaugh sure as hell better be held responsible for a mistake he made. Full. Stop.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Handyman</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;">I got my start in Digital Marketing </h2><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">back in 2004 at a little company called Infusion Software and Consulting, which you now know as Infusionsoft. When I started, the entire company (including the servers that housed <em>all</em> of the company data) fit comfortably into a 1500 square foot office. </p>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1600.0"]<img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/t/5bbe7d3671c10b9ad6313eb1/1545677844702/IMG_1168.JPG?format=original" alt=" Infusionsoft Support Office, circa 2007 "/>  Infusionsoft Support Office, circa 2007 [/caption] 
  

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Since I left, Infusionsoft has created and provided many resources for its customers to help them learn and use the software profitably. But before there was Infusionsoft University, Implementation Accelerators, or Infusioncon, there was me. Just little old me, helping customers get more from the software.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In 2008, I left Infusionsoft and started on a path that would connect me with the best minds in marketing, technology, implementation, and strategy. Even more importantly, I would employ every type of “agency model” in existence, and would see first hand the effects of each.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">From my time with SixthDivision and PlusThis to working directly with Frank Kern, I got a front-row seat to how these different models function. The thing that became glaringly obvious is that none of the models were set up with the customer’s long-term benefit as the primary goal. They were all set up to get the most money out of the customer while doing as little as possible.</p><h3 style="text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;">Agencies Lose Money Delivering Services</h3>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1936.0"]<img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/t/5bbe7d84f4e1fcee42f6b2be/1539210638806/2012-03-31+09.01.34.jpg?format=original" alt=" SixthDivision Booth, Infusioncon 2012 "/>  SixthDivision Booth, Infusioncon 2012 [/caption] 
  

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Agencies won’t tell you this, but it is not in their best interest to provide you services, especially when you pay for them. They don’t make money by providing services. They make money by <em>selling</em>  services, and they <em>profit</em> from their ability to do as little as possible from that point on.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">That’s not to say that all agencies are bad and you should avoid them, however. Some agencies have (at least subconsciously) recognized this innate flaw and have designed their services around it. I call these “Event-Style” agencies. They are the most up-front about the lack of ongoing service, and we are ok with it because they promise to make up for it with massive initial implementation.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The real issue with agencies is that they hold all the cards. They have the strategic expertise and the technical know-how, and you’re essentially at their mercy. You can only grow as fast as they can spare the resources for you.</p><h3 style="text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;">But don’t I still need them?</h3><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Not really. It’s true, agencies tend to have a greater <em>capacity</em> than you, and usually have more experience and can shorten the learning curve and blah blah blah. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But the problem with an <em>agency</em> is they will sell you on more than you need so they can charge you for more than they should, all while making it appear that they’re doing more than they are.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">No, you don’t need an agency.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You need a handyman.</p><hr /><h3 style="text-align: center; white-space: pre-wrap;">What I Do</h3><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If it happens online, it's my expertise. I've been at it for over 15 years, and I've literally worked with every type of business.&nbsp;I've helped over 500 businesses solve the day-to-day, tactical problems which has helped those businesses generate over $250 million (that I know of).&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If you need help, all you need to do is <strong>text me at (858) 683-6814</strong> and we’ll take it from there. But first, take a look at what some real people say about me:</p>

<h1 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I’m Bret. I’m a Martineau, a marketer, a musician, and a Muay Thai fighter. </h1><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I’m also into writing, photography, dogs, and the Oxford Comma.</h2><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I believe life is about action. It’s about experiencing everything you possibly can and using those experiences to shape a better world for yourself and those around you. I think we’re all unique, so what makes me happy and gives me purpose may not be the same for you, and <em>that’s ok</em>.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I don’t believe in doing things simply because “that’s the way these things are done.” In fact, if you try and box me into someone else’s paradigm and expect me to just accept it, you’ve got another thing coming. There are no absolutes. Everything is meant to be tested. Just because something worked in one situation doesn’t mean it will work in all situations.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And lastly, I’ve spent a lot of time studying just about every philosophy and religion, and they all boil down to what I consider my personal mantra:</p><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Don’t Be A Dick.</h2><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If there is any way I can help you, please don’t hesitate to reach out. You can text me (858 683 6814) or hit me up on any form of social media (@bretwardjames on all the platforms)&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Word,</p><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>Bret* </strong></h2><h3 style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><em>*yeah, only one “t”</em></h3>]]></content:encoded>

<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>I got my start in Digital Marketing</strong> back in 2004 at a little company called Infusion Software and Consulting, which you now know as Infusionsoft.   When I started, the entire company (including the servers that house<em>d a</em>ll of the company data) fit comfortably into a 1500 square foot office.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Since I left, Infusionsoft has created and provided many resources for its customers to help them learn and use the software profitably. But before there was Infusionsoft University, Implementation Accelerators, or Infusioncon, there was me. Just little old me, helping customers get more from the software.  </p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In 2008, I left Infusionsoft and started on a path that would connect me with the best minds in marketing, technology, implementation, and strategy. </p>

<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I helped to build SixthDivision and PlusThis from the ground up.  </p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I ran Frank Kern's implementation bootcamp events for a year (I built his template campaigns as well).  </p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I built Sam Oven's first multi-million dollar webinar funnel.  </p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I've helped over 500 businesses solve the day-to-day, tactical problems which has helped those businesses generate over $250 million (that I know of).   </p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If it happens online, it's my expertise. I've been at it for over 15 years, and I've literally worked with every type of business.  <br>    </p><hr /><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Interested in what some real people say about me?</h2>
